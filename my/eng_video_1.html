<div id="TextSection" dir="ltr"><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	How do you explain when things don't go as we assume?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Or better, how do you explain</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the
	assumptions?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	For example</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Why is Apple so innovative?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Year after year, after year,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they're more innovative than all their competition.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And yet, they're just a computer company.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They're just like everyone else.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They have the same access to the same talent,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	the same agencies,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	the same consultants, the same media.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Then why is it that they seem to have something different?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Why him?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And why is it that the Wright brothers</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	when there were certainly other teams</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	who were better qualified, better funded --</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and they didn't achieve powered man flight,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and the Wright brothers beat them to it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	There's something else at play here.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the
	world worked,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	As it turns out, there's a pattern.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	As it turns out, all the great inspiring leaders and organizations
	in the world,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they all think, act and communicate the exact same way.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And it's the complete opposite to everyone else.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	All I did was codify it,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and it's probably the world's simplest idea.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I call it the golden circle.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Why? How? What?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	This little idea explains</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where
	others aren't.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Let me define the terms really quickly.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Every single person, every single organization on the planet</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	knows what they do,  percent.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Some know how they do it,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	whether you call it your differentiated value proposition</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	or your proprietary process or your USP.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what
	they do.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And by &quot;why&quot; I don't mean &quot;to make a profit.&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	That's a result. It's always a result.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	By &quot;why,&quot; I mean What's your purpose?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	What's your cause? What's your belief?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Why does your organization exist?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Why do you get out of bed in the morning?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And why should anyone care?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	As a result, the way we think, we act,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	the way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvious.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations --</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	regardless of their size, regardless of their industry --</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	all think, act and communicate from the inside out.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Let me give you an example.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets
	it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	If Apple were like everyone else,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	a marketing message from them might sound like this</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	&quot;We make great computers.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Want to buy one?&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	&quot;Meh.&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	That's how most of us communicate.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	That's how most marketing and sales are done,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	that's how we communicate interpersonally.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We say what we do,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	we say how we're different or better</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and we expect some sort of a behavior,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	a purchase, a vote, something like that.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Here's our new law firm</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	we always perform for our clients.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Here's our new car</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Buy our car.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	But it's uninspiring.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Here's how Apple actually communicates.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	&quot;Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We believe in thinking differently.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The way we challenge the status quo</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	is by making our products beautifully designed,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	simple to use and user friendly.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We just happen to make great computers.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Want to buy one?&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Totally different, right?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	You're ready to buy a computer from me.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I just reversed the order of the information.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	people buy why you do it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	This explains why every single person in this room</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	But we're also perfectly comfortable</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	buying an MP player from Apple, or a phone from Apple,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	or a DVR from Apple.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	As I said before, Apple's just a computer company.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their
	competitors.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these
	products.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	In fact, they tried.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They've been making flat-screen monitors for years.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Nobody bought one.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Dell came out with MP players and PDAs,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and they make great quality products,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and they can make perfectly well-designed products --</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and nobody bought one.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	buying an MP player from Dell.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Why would you buy one from a computer company?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	But we do it every day.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you
	have.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Here's the best part</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	None of what I'm telling you is my opinion.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It's all grounded in the tenets of biology.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Not psychology, biology.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	If you look at a cross-section of the human brain,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	from the top down, the human brain is actually broken</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	into three major components</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	that correlate perfectly with the golden circle.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	our neocortex,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	corresponds with the &quot;what&quot; level.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The neocortex is responsible</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	for all of our rational and analytical thought and language.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The middle two sections make up our limbic brains,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	like trust and loyalty.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It's also responsible for all human behavior,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	all decision-making,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and it has no capacity for language.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	In other words, when we communicate from the outside in,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	like features and benefits and facts and figures.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It just doesn't drive behavior.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	When we can communicate from the inside out,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	we're talking directly to the part of the brain</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	that controls behavior,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things
	we say and do.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	This is where gut decisions come from.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and they say, &quot;I know what all the facts and details say,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	but it just doesn't feel right.&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Why would we use that verb, it doesn't &quot;feel&quot; right?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	doesn't control language.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The best we can muster up is,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	&quot;I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts</p>

	It's all happening here in your limbic brain,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not
	language.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	But if you don't know why you do what you do,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and people respond to why you do what you do,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	then how will you ever get people</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	to vote for you, or buy something from you,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	or, more importantly, be loyal</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and want to be a part of what it is that you do.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The goal is not just to hire people who need a job;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	it's to hire people who believe what you believe.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I always say that, you know,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for
	your money,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	but if they believe what you believe,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright
	brothers.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And back in the early th century,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Everybody was trying it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	to be the recipe for success.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Even now, you ask people,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	&quot;Why did your product or why did your company fail?&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and people always give you the same permutation</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	of the same three things</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It's always the same three things, so let's explore that.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Samuel Pierpont Langley</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	was given , dollars by the War Department</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	to figure out this flying machine.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Money was no problem.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He held a seat at Harvard</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	he knew all the big minds of the day.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He hired the best minds money could find</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and the market conditions were fantastic.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The New York Times followed him around everywhere,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and everyone was rooting for Langley.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Orville and Wilbur Wright,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They had no money;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Not a single person on the Wright brothers' team</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	had a college education,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	not even Orville or Wilbur.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And The New York Times followed them around nowhere.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The difference was,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a
	belief.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	it'll change the course of the world.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He was in pursuit of the result.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He was in pursuit of the riches.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And lo and behold, look what happened.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	worked with them with blood and sweat and tears.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The others just worked for the paycheck.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they would have to take five sets of parts,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	because that's how many times they would crash before supper.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And, eventually, on December th, ,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	the Wright brothers took flight,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and no one was there to even experience it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We found out about it a few days later.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	the day the Wright brothers took flight,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	he quit.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He could have said,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	&quot;That's an amazing discovery, guys,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and I will improve upon your technology,&quot; but he didn't.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous, so he
	quit.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	If you talk about what you believe,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	you will attract those who believe what you believe.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	But why is it important to attract those who believe what you
	believe?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Something called the law of diffusion of innovation,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	if you don't know the law, you know the terminology.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The first .% of our population are our innovators.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The next .% of our population are our early adopters.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The next % are your early majority,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	your late majority and your laggards.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	(Laughter)</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We all sit at various places at various times on this scale,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of
	an idea,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	between  and  percent market penetration,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and then the system tips.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I love asking businesses, &quot;What's your conversion on new
	business?&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They love to tell you, &quot;It's about  percent,&quot; proudly.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Well, you can trip over % of the customers.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We all have about % who just &quot;get it.&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	That's how we describe them, right?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	That's like that gut feeling, &quot;Oh, they just get it.&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The problem is How do you find the ones that get it</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	before doing business versus the ones who don't get it?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	So it's this here, this little gap that you have to close,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	as Jeffrey Moore calls it, &quot;Crossing the Chasm&quot; --</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	because, you see, the early majority will not try something</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	until someone else has tried it first.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they're comfortable making those gut decisions.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	that are driven by what they believe about the world</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and not just what product is available.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	These are the people who stood in line for six hours</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	to buy an iPhone when they first came out,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	These are the people who spent , dollars</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	on flat-screen TVs when they first came out,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	even though the technology was substandard.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so
	great;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they did it for themselves.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It's because they wanted to be first.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and what you do simply proves what you believe.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	stood in line for six hours,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	was because of what they believed about the world,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and how they wanted everybody to see them</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they were first.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	So let me give you a famous example,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of
	innovation.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	First, the famous failure.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It's a commercial example.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	As we said before, the recipe for success</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	is money and the right people and the right market conditions.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	You should have success then.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Look at TiVo.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	to this current day,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they are the single highest-quality product on the market,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	hands down, there is no dispute.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They were extremely well-funded.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Market conditions were fantastic.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I mean, we use TiVo as verb.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	(Laughter)</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	But TiVo's a commercial failure.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They've never made money.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And when they went IPO,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	their stock was at about  or  dollars</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and then plummeted, and it's never traded above .</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	except for a couple of little spikes.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Because you see, when TiVo launched their product,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	they told us all what they had.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They said, &quot;We have a product that pauses live TV,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	without you even asking.&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And the cynical majority said,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	&quot;We don't believe you.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We don't need it. We don't like it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	You're scaring us.&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	What if they had said,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	&quot;If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	over every aspect of your life,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	boy, do we have a product for you.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It pauses live TV, skips commercials,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc.&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of
	innovation.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	In the summer of ,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	, people showed up on the mall in Washington</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	to hear Dr. King speak.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They sent out no invitations,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	and there was no website to check the date.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	How do you do that?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	who was a great orator.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He wasn't the only man in America who suffered</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	in a pre-civil rights America.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	In fact, some of his ideas were bad.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	But he had a gift.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	He went around and told people what he believed.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	&quot;I believe, I believe, I believe,&quot; he told people.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And people who believed what he believed</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And some of those people created structures</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	to get the word out to even more people.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And lo and behold, , people showed up</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	on the right day at the right time to hear him speak.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	How many of them showed up for him?</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Zero.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They showed up for themselves.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It's what they believed about America</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	% of the audience was white.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by
	men.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And not until all the laws that are made by men</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	will we live in a just world.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We followed, not for him, but for ourselves.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	By the way, he gave the &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	not the &quot;I have a plan&quot; speech.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	(Laughter)</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive -point plans.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	They're not inspiring anybody.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Leaders hold a position of power or authority,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	but those who lead inspire us.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Whether they're individuals or organizations,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	we follow those who lead, not because we have to,</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	but because we want to.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	And it's those who start with &quot;why&quot;</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	that have the ability to inspire those around them</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	or find others who inspire them.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Thank you very much.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	(Applause)</p>
