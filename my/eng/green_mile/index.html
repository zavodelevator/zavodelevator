The story which begins in this little book exists in this form because of a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chance remark made by a realtor I have never met. This happened a year ago, on Long Island. Ralph</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Vicinanza, a long-time friend and business associate of mine (what he does mostly is to sell foreign</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">publishing rights for books and stories), had just rented a house there. The realtor remarked that the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house &quot;looked like something out of a story by Charles Dickens.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The remark was still on Ralph&apos;s mind when he welcomed his first houseguest, British publisher Malcolm</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Edwards. He repeated it to Edwards, and they began chatting about Dickens. Edwards mentioned that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dickens had published many of his novels in installments, either folded into magazines or by themselves</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as chapbooks, (I don&apos;t know the origin of this word, meaning a smaller-than-average book, but have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">always loved its air of intimacy and friendliness). Some of the novels, Edwards added, were actually</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">written and revised in the shadow of publication; Charles Dickens was one novelist apparently not afraid</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y12 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of a deadline.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dickens&apos;s serialized novels were immensely popular; so popular, in fact, that one of them precipitated a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tragedy in Baltimore. A large group of Dickens fans crowded onto a waterfront dock, anticipating the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arrival of an English ship with copies of the final installment of <span class="ff4">The Old Curiosity Shop</span> on board.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y16 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">According to the story, several would-be readers were jostled into the water and drowned.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y17 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I don&apos;t think either Malcolm. or Ralph wanted anyone drowned, but they were curious as to what would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happen if serial publication were tried again today. Neither was immediately aware that it has happened</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(there really is nothing new under the sun) on at least two occasions. Tom Wolfe published the first draft</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his novel <span class="ff4">Bonfire of the Vanities</span> serially in <span class="ff4">Rolling Stone </span>magazine, and Michael McDowell <span class="ff4">(The</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amulet, Gilded Needles, The Elementals,<span class="ff3"> and the screenplay </span>Beetlejuice)<span class="ff3"> published a novel called</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Blackwater<span class="ff3"> in paperback installments. That novel - a horror story about a Southern family with the</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unpleasant familial trait of turning into alligators - was not McDowell&apos;s best, but enjoyed good success</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Avon Books, all the same.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The two men further speculated about what might happen if a writer of popular fiction were to try issuing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y20 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a novel in chapbook editions today - little paperbacks that might sell for a pound or two in Britain, or</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">perhaps three dollars in America (where most paperbacks now sell for $6.99 or $7.99). Someone like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stephen King might make an interesting go of such an experiment, Malcolm said, and from there the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conversation moved on to other topics.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y24 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ralph more or less forgot the idea, but it recurred to him in the fall of 1995, following his return from the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Frankfurt Book Fair, a kind of international trade show where every day is a showdown for foreign</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y26 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agents like Ralph.

I don&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think that I am a modern Dickens-if such a person exists, it is probably John Irving or Salman Rushdie -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I have always loved stories told in episodes. It is a format I first encountered in <span class="ff4">The Saturday Evening</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Post,<span class="ff3"> and I liked it because the end of each episode made the reader an almost equal participant with the</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">writer-you had a whole week to try to figure out the next twist of the snake. Also, one read and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">experienced these stories more <span class="ff4">intensely,</span> it seemed to me, because they were rationed. You couldn&apos;t gulp,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even if you wanted to (and if the story was good, you did).</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Best of all, in my house we often read them aloud-my brother, David, one night, myself the next, my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother taking a turn on the third, then back to my brother again. It was a rare chance to enjoy a written</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work as we enjoyed the movies we went to and the TV programs <span class="ff4">(Rawhide, Bonanza. Route 66)</span> that we</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">watched together; they were a family event . It wasn&apos;t until years later that I discovered Dickens&apos;s novels</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been enjoyed by families of his day in much the same fashion. only their fireside agonizings over the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fate of Pip and Oliver and David Copperfield went on for years instead of a couple of months (even the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">longest of the <span class="ff4">Post</span> serials rarely ran much more than eight installments).</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was one other thing that I liked about the idea, an appeal that I suspect only the writer of suspense</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tales and spooky stories can fully appreciate: in a story which is published m installments, the writer</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gains an ascendancy over the reader which he or she cannot otherwise enjoy: simply put. Constant</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Reader, you cannot flip ahead and see how matters turn out.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I still remember walking into our living room once when I was twelve or so and seeing my mother in her</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">favorite rocker, peeking at the end of an Agatha Christie paperback while her finger held her actual place</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">around page 50. I was appalled, and told her so Q was twelve. remember. an age at which boys first</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dimly begin to realize that they know everything), suggesting that reading the end of a mystery novel</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before you actually get there was on a par with eating the white stuff out of the middle of Oreo cookies</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and then throwing the cookies themselves away. She laughed her wonderful unembarrassed laugh and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said perhaps that was so, but sometimes she just couldn&apos;t resist the temptation. Giving in to temptation</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a concept I could understand; I had plenty of my own, even at twelve. But here, at last, is an amusing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cure for that temptation. Until the final episode arrives in bookstores, no one is going to know how <span class="ff4">The</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y44 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Green Mile<span class="ff3"> turns out ... and that may include me.</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although there was no way he could have known it, Ralph Vicinanza, mentioned the idea of a novel in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y46 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">installments at what was, for me, the perfect psychological moment. I had been playing with a story idea</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on a subject I had always suspected I would get around to sooner or later: the electric chair. &quot;Old Sparky&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y48 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has fascinated me ever since my first James Cagney movie, and the first Death Row tales I ever read (in a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y49 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book called <span class="ff4">Twenty Thousand </span>Years <span class="ff4">in Sing Sing,</span> written by Warden Lewis E. Lawes) fired the darker</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">side of my imagination. What, I wondered, would it be like to walk those last forty yards to the electric</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chair, knowing you were going to die there? Mat, for that matter, would it be like to be the man who had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to strap the condemned in ... or pull the switch? What would such a job take out of you? Even creepier,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what might it add?</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I had tried these basic ideas, always tentatively, on a number of different frameworks over the last twenty</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or thirty years. I had written one successful novella set in prison <span class="ff4">(Rita Hayworth and Shawshank</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y50 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Redemption),<span class="ff3"> and had sort of come to the conclusion that that was probably it for me, when this take on</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y51 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the idea came along. There were lots of things I liked about it, but nothing more than the narrator&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y52 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">essentially decent voice; low-key, honest, perhaps a little wide-eyed, he is a Stephen King narrator if ever</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

And I liked the high-wire aspect of it, too: fall down on the job, fail to carry</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through, and all at once about a million readers are howling for your blood. No one knows this any better</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than me, unless it&apos;s my secretary, Juliann Eugley; we get dozens of angry letters each week, demanding</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the next book in the <span class="ff4">Dark Tower</span> cycle (patience, followers of Roland; another year or so and your wait</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will end, I promise).

She waited until he got his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y73 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">overcoat half off, then dropped his cheating guts onto his two-tone shoes. Used one of Cutter&apos;s own</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y74 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">razors to do it. Two nights before she was due to sit in Old Sparky, she called me to her cell and said she</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y75 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been visited by her African spirit-father in a dream. He told her to discard her slave-name and to die</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y76 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">under her free name, Matuomi. That was her request, that her death warrant should be read under the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y77 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">name of Beverly Matuomi. I guess her spirit-father didn&apos;t give her any first name, or one she could make</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y78 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out, anyhow. I said yes, okay, fine. One thing those years serving as the bull-goose screw taught me was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y79 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never to refuse the condemned unless I absolutely had to. In the case of Beverly Matuomi, it made no</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y7a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difference anyway. The governor called the next day around three in the afternoon, commuting her</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y7b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sentence to life in the Grassy Valley Penal Facility for Women-all penal and no penis, we used to say</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y7c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back then. I was glad to see Bev&apos;s round ass going left instead of right when she got to the duty desk, let</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y7d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me tell you.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y7e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thirty-five years or so later - had to be at least thirty-five - I saw that name on the obituary page of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y7f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">paper, under a picture of a skinny-faced black lady with a cloud of white hair and glasses with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y80 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rhinestones at the corners.

There was only one time I ever had a question</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y82 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the nature of my job. That, I reckon, is why I&apos;m writing this.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The wide corridor up the center of E Block was floored with linoleum the color of tired old limes, and so</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what was called the Last Mile at other prisons was called the Green Mile at Cold Mountain. It ran, I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guess, sixty long paces from south to north, bottom to top. At the bottom was the restraint room. At the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">top end was a T-junction. A left turn meant life-if you called what went on in the sunbaked exercise yard</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life, and many did; many lived it for years, with no apparent ill effects. Thieves and arsonists and sex</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">criminals, all talking their talk and walking their walk and making their little deals.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A right turn, though - that was different. First you went into my office (where the carpet was also green,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a thing I kept meaning to change and not getting around to), and crossed in front of my desk, which was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flanked by the American flag on the left and the state flag on the right. On the far side were two doors.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One led into the small W.C. that I and the Block E guards (sometimes even Warden Moores) used; the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y70 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other opened on a kind of storage shed. This was where you ended up when you walked the Green Mile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was a small door - I had to duck my head when I went through, and John Coffey actually had to sit and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scoot. You came out on a little landing, then went down three cement steps to a board floor. It was a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miserable room without heat and with a metal roof, just like the one on the block to which it was an</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">adjunct. It was cold enough in there to see your breath during the winter, and stifling in the summer. At</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the execution of Elmer Manfred - in July or August of &apos;30, that one was, I believe-we had nine witnesses</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pass out.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the left side of the storage shed - again - there was life. Tools (all locked down in frames</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">criss-crossed with chains, as if they were carbine rifles instead of spades and pickaxes), dry goods, sacks</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of seeds for spring planting in the prison gardens, boxes of toilet paper, pallets cross-loaded with blanks</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y46 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the prison plate-shop... even bags of lime for marking out the baseball diamond and the football</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gridiron - the cons played in what was known as The Pasture, and fall afternoons were greatly looked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y48 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forward to at Cold Mountain.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y85 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the right - once again - death. Old Sparky his ownself, sitting up on a plank platform at the southeast</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y86 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corner of the store room, stout oak legs, broad oak arms that had absorbed the terrorized sweat of scores</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y87 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of men in the last few minutes of their lives, and the metal cap, usually hung jauntily on the back of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chair, like some robot kid&apos;s beanie in a Buck Rogers comic-strip. A cord ran from it and through a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y89 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gasket-circled hole in the cinderblock wall behind the chair. Off to one side was a galvanized tin bucket.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">If you looked inside it, you would see a circle of sponge, cut just right to fit the metal cap.

The details would be in the papers, still there for anyone who cared</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enough to look them out - someone with more energy than one very old man whittling away the end of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his life in a Georgia nursing home. That was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a hot fall, I remember that; very hot, indeed. October almost like August, and the warden&apos;s wife, Melinda,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up in the hospital at Indianola for a spell. It was the fall I had the worst urinary infection of my life, not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bad enough to put me in the hospital myself, but almost bad enough for me to wish I was dead every time</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I took a leak. It was the fall of Delacroix, the little half-bald Frenchman with the mouse, the one that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came in the summer and did that cute trick with the spool. Mostly, though, it was the fall that John</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Coffey came to E Block, sentenced to death for the rape-murder of the Detterick twins.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There were four or five guards on the block each shift, but a lot of them were floaters. Dean Stanton,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry Terwilliger, and Brutus Howell (the men called him &quot;Brutal,&quot; but it was a joke, he wouldn&apos;t hurt a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fly unless he had to, in spite of his size) are all dead now, and so is Percy Wetmore, who really was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brutal ... not to mention stupid. Percy had no business on E Block, where an ugly nature was useless and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sometimes dangerous, but he was related to the governor by marriage, and so he stayed.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was Percy Wetmore who ushered Coffey onto the block, with the supposedly traditional cry of &quot;Dead</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man walking! Dead man walking here!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was still as hot as the hinges of hell, October or not. The door to the exercise yard opened, letting in a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flood of brilliant light and the biggest man I&apos;ve ever seen, except for some of the basketball fellows they</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have on the TV down in the &quot;Resource Room&quot; of this home for wayward droolers I&apos;ve finished up in. He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wore chains on his arms and across his water-barrel of a chest; he wore legirons on his ankles and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y91 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shuffled a chain between them that sounded like cascading coins as it ran along the lime - colored</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y92 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corridor between the cells. Percy Wetmore was on one side of him, skinny little Harry Terwilliger was on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y62 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the other, and they looked like children walking along with a captured bear. Even Brutus Howell looked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y63 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like a kid next to Coffey, and Brutal was over six feet tall and broad as well, a football tackle who had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y64 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gone on to play at LSU until he flunked out and came back home to the ridges.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey was black, like most of the men who came to stay for awhile in E Block before dying in Old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y93 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sparky&apos;s lap, and he stood six feet, eight inches tall. He wasn&apos;t all willowy like the TV basketball fellows,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y94 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though - he was broad in the shoulders and deep through the chest, laced over with muscle in every</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y95 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">direction. They&apos;d put him in the biggest denims they could find in Stores, and still the cuffs of the pants</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y96 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rode halfway up on his bunched and scarred calves. The shirt was open to below his chest, and the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y97 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sleeves stopped somewhere on his forearms. He was holding his cap in one huge hand, which was just as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y98 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well; perched on his bald mahogany ball of a head, it would have looked like the kind of cap an</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y85 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">organgrinder&apos;s monkey wears, only blue instead of red. He looked like he could have snapped the chains</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y86 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that held him as easily as you might snap the ribbons on a Christmas present, but when you looked in his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y87 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">face, you knew he wasn&apos;t going to do anything like that. It wasn&apos;t dull-although that was what Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought, it wasn&apos;t long before Percy was calling him the ijit - but lost. He kept looking around as if to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y89 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make out where he was. Maybe even who he was. My first thought was that he looked like a black</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samson ... only after Delilah had shaved him smooth as her faithless little hand and taken all the fun out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of him.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y99 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Dead man walking!&quot; Percy trumpeted, hauling on that bear of a man&apos;s wristcuff, as if he really believed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he could move him if Coffey decided he didn&apos;t want to move anymore on his own. Harry didn&apos;t say</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything, but he looked embarrassed. &quot;Dead man---!&apos;</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Percy gave me a look that said we all knew I was an asshole (except</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the big dummy, of course, who only knew how to rape and murder little girls), but he didn&apos;t say</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The three of them stopped outside the cell door, which was standing open on its track.

He had to duck his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yae ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">head just to enter the cell.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yaf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked up and down mostly to register his height as a fact and not an optical illusion. It was real: six</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feet, eight inches. His weight was given as two-eighty, but I think that was only an estimate; he had to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have been three hundred and twenty, maybe as much as three hundred and fifty pounds. Under the space</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for scars and identifying marks, one word had been blocked out in the laborious printing of Magnusson,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the old trusty in Registration: <span class="ff4">Numerous.</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked up.

Del was a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slight, balding man with the worried face of an accountant who knows his embezzlement will soon be</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discovered. His tame mouse was sitting on his shoulder.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy Wetmore was leaning in the doorway of the cell which had just become John Coffey&apos;s. He had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taken his hickory baton out of the custom-made holster he carried it in, and was tapping it against one</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">palm the way a man does when he has a toy he wants to use. And all at once I couldn&apos;t stand to have him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there. Maybe it was the unseasonable heat, maybe it was the urinary infection heating up my groin and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">making the itch of my flannel underwear all but unbearable, maybe it was knowing that the state had sent</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me a black man next door to an idiot to execute, and Percy clearly wanted to hand-tool him a little first.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Probably it was all those things.

Bill Dodge and his men were moving boxes and stacks of sheets, even the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beds; the whole infirmary was going to a new frame building over on the west side of the prison. Hot</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work, heavy lifting. Percy Wetmore wanted no part of either.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;They got all the men they need,&quot; he said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Then get over there and straw-boss,&quot; I said, raising my voice. I saw Harry wince and paid no attention.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">If the governor ordered Warden Moores to fire me for ruffling the wrong set of feathers, who was Hal</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moores going to put in my place? Percy? It was a joke. &quot;I really don&apos;t care what you do, Percy, as long as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you get out of here for awhile!&apos;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For a moment I thought he was going to stick and there&apos;d be real trouble, with Coffey standing there the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole time like the world&apos;s biggest stopped clock. Then Percy rammed his billy back into its hand-tooled</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">holster-foolish damned vanitorious thing - and went stalking up the corridor. I don&apos;t remember which</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guard was sitting at the duty desk that day-one of the floaters, I guess - but Percy must not have liked the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way he looked, because he growled, &quot;You wipe that smirk off your shitepoke face or I&apos;ll wipe it off for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you&quot; as he went by. There was a rattle of keys, a momentary blast of hot sunlight from the exercise yard,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and then Percy Wetmore was gone, at least for the time being. Delacroix&apos;s mouse ran back and forth from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one of the little Frenchman&apos;s shoulders to the other, his filament whiskers twitching.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Be still, Mr. Jingles,&quot; Delacroix said, and the mouse stopped on his left shoulder just as if he had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understood. &quot;Just be so still and so quiet.&quot; In Delacroix&apos;s lilting Cajun accent, <span class="ff4">quiet</span> came out sounding</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exotic and <span class="ff4">foreign - kwaht.</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yda ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You go lie down, Del,&quot; I said curtly. &quot;Take you a rest. This is none of your business, either!&apos;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He did as I said. He had raped a young girl and killed her, and had then dropped her body behind the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">apartment house where she lived, doused it with coal-oil, and then set it on fire, hoping in some muddled</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way to dispose of the evidence of his crime. The fire had spread to the building itself, had engulfed it,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yde ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and six more people had died, two of them children. It was the only crime he had in him, and now he was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just a mild-mannered man with a worried face, a bald pate, and long hair straggling over the back of his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shirt-collar. He would sit down with Old Sparky in a little while, and Old Sparky would make an end to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him ... but whatever it was that had done that awful thing was already gone, and now he lay on his bunk,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">letting his little companion run squeaking over his hands. In a way, that was the worst; Old Sparky never</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">burned what was inside them, and the drugs they inject them with today don&apos;t put it to sleep. It vacates,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jumps to someone else, and leaves us to kill husks that aren&apos;t really alive anyway.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I turned my attention to the giant.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

It was like his head-shake: down , up, back to center. His strange eyes looked at me. There</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y54 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a kind of peace in them, but not a kind I was sure I could trust. I crooked a finger to Harry, who</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came in and unlocked the chains. He showed no fear now, even when he knelt between Coffey&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treetrunk legs to unlock the ankle irons, and that eased me some. It was Percy who had made Harry</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nervous, and I trusted Harry&apos;s instincts. I trusted the instincts of all my day-to-day E Block men, except</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Percy.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I have a little set speech I make to men new on the block, but I hesitated with Coffey, because he seemed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so abnormal, and not just in his size.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Harry stood back (Coffey had remained motionless during the entire unlocking ceremony, as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">placid as a Percheron), I looked up at my new charge, tapping on the clipboard with my thumb, and said:</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Can you talk, big boy?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, sir, boss, I can talk,&quot; he said. His voice was a deep and quiet rumble. It made me think of a freshly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tuned tractor engine. He had no real Southern drawl-he said I, not Ah-but there was a kind of Southern</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">construction to his speech that I noticed later. As if he was from the South, but not of it. He didn&apos;t sound</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">illiterate, but he didn&apos;t sound educated. In his speech as in so many other things, he was a mystery.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mostly it was his eyes that troubled me - a kind of peaceful absence in them, as if he were floating far,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">far away.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Your name is John Coffey.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, sir, boss, like the drink only not spelled the same way.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;So you can spell, can you? Read and write?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yef ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Just my name, boss,&quot; said he, serenely.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I sighed, then gave him a short version of my set speech. I&apos;d already decided he wasn&apos;t going to be any</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trouble. In that I was both right and wrong.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;My name is Paul Edgecombe,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m the E Block super - the head screw. You want something</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from me, ask for me by name. If I&apos;m not here, ask this other, man - his name is Harry Terwilliger. Or you</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ask for Mr. Stanton or Mr. Howell. Do you understand that?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Coffey nodded.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Just don&apos;t expect to get what you want unless we decide it&apos;s what you need - this isn&apos;t a hotel. Still with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He nodded again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This is a quiet place, big boy - not like the rest of the prison. It&apos;s just you and Delacroix over there. You</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfa ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">won&apos;t work; mostly you&apos;ll just sit. Give you a chance to think things over.&quot; Too much time for most of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them, but I didn&apos;t say that. &quot;Sometimes we play the radio, if all&apos;s in order. You like the radio?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He nodded, but doubtfully, as if he wasn&apos;t sure what the radio was.

And I really</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y100 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hadn&apos;t expected any different. Appeals weren&apos;t for the likes of John Coffey, not back then; they had their</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y101 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day in court and then the world forgot them until they saw a squib in the paper saying a certain fellow</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had taken a little electricity along about midnight. But a man with a wife, children, or friends to look</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forward to on Sunday afternoons was easier to control, if control looked to be a problem. Here it didn&apos;t,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and that was good. Because he was so damned big.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I shifted a little on the bunk, then decided I might feel a little more comfortable in my nether parts if I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood up, and so I did.

More pork in someone&apos;s pocket was what I thought, but the Depression was on, and I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y12c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kept my opinions to myself - the way I should have kept my mouth shut about Percy, but sometimes a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y12d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man just can&apos;t keep it clapped tight. A man&apos;s mouth gets him in more trouble than his pecker ever could,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y12e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">most of the time. And the auto shop never happened, anyway - the next spring, the prison moved sixty</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y12f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miles down the road to Brighton. More backroom deals, I reckon. More barrels of pork. Wasn&apos;t nothing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y130 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to me.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y131 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Administration had gone to a new building on the east side of the yard; the infirmary was being moved</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y132 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(whose country-bumpkin idea it had been to put an infirmary on the second floor in the first place was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y133 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just another of life&apos;s mysteries); the library was still partly stocked - not that it ever had much in it - and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y134 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing empty. The old building was a hot clapboard box kind of shouldered in between A and B</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y135 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Blocks. Their bathrooms backed up on it and the whole building was always swimming with this vague</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y136 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pissy smell, which was probably the only good reason for the move. The library was L-shaped, and not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much bigger than my office. I looked for a fan, but they were all gone. It must have been a hundred</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">degrees in there, and I could feel that hot throb in my groin when I sat down. Sort of like an infected</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tooth. I know that&apos;s absurd, considering the region we&apos;re talking about here, but it&apos;s the only thing I could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y137 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">compare it to.

The heat wasn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bothering him, nor were the grunts, thumps, and occasional curses from the infirmary upstairs (where it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to be at least ten degrees hotter, and I hoped Percy Wetmore was enjoying it). I didn&apos;t bother him,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">either, but went around to the short side of the L, where the newspapers were kept. I thought they might</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be gone along with the fans, in spite of what Dean had said. They weren&apos;t, though, and the business about</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Detterick twins was easily enough looked out; it had been front-page news from the commission of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the crime in June right through the trial in late August and September.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

There were no more cotton</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plantations, but there were forty or fifty prosperous cotton farms in the southern part of our state. Klaus</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Detterick owned one of them. By the standards of the nineteen-fifties he would have been considered</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only a rung above shirttail poor, but by those of the thirties he was considered well-to-do because he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actually paid his store bill in cash at the end of most months, and he could meet the bank president&apos;s eyes</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">if they happened to pass on the street. The farmhouse was clean and commodious. In addition to the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cotton, there were the other two c&apos;s: chickens and a few cows. He and his wife had three children:</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Howard. who was twelve or thereabouts, and the twin girls. Cora and Kathe.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y60 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On a warm night in June of that year, the girls asked for and were given permission to sleep on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">screen-enclosed side porch, which ran the length of the house. This was a great treat for them. Their</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother kissed them goodnight just shy of nine, when the last light had gone out of the sky. It was the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">final time she saw either of them until they were in their coffins and the undertaker had repaired the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worst of the damage.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y92 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Country families went to bed early in those days - &quot;soon as &apos;twas dark under the table,&quot; my own mother</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y62 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sometimes said - and slept soundly. Certainly Klaus, Marjorie, and Howie Detterick did on the night the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y63 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">twins were taken. Klaus would almost certainly have been wakened by Bowser, the family&apos;s big old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y64 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">half-breed collie, if he had barked, but Bowser didn&apos;t. Not that night, not ever again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Klaus was up at first light to do the milking. The porch was on the side of the house away from the barn,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y93 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Klaus never thought to look in on the girls. Bowser&apos;s failure to join him was no cause for alarm,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y94 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">either. The dog held the cows and the chickens alike in great disdain, and usually hid in his doghouse</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y95 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">behind the barn when the chores were being performed, unless called ... and called energetically, at that.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Marjorie came downstairs fifteen minutes or so after her husband had pulled on his boots in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mudroom and tromped out to the barn. She started the coffee, then put bacon on to fry. The combined</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smells brought Howie down from his room under the eaves, but not the girls from the porch. She sent</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Howie out to fetch them as she cracked eggs into the bacon grease. Klaus would want the girls out to get</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y140 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fresh ones as soon as breakfast was over. Except no breakfast was eaten in the Detterick house that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y141 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">morning. Howie came back from the porch, white around the gills and with his formerly sleep-puffy eyes</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y142 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now wide open.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y143 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;They&apos;re gone,&quot; he said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y144 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Marjorie went out onto the porch, at first more annoyed than alarmed. She said later that she had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y145 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supposed, if she had supposed anything, that the girls had decided to take a walk and pick flowers by the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y146 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dawn&apos;s early light. That or some similar green-girl foolishness.

What he found on the porch would have jellied the legs</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the most courageous parent. The blankets in which the girls would have bundled themselves as the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night drew on and grew colder had been cast into one comer. The screen door had been yanked off its</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upper hinge and hung drunkenly out into the dooryard. And on the boards of both the porch and the steps</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beyond the mutilated screen door, there were spatters of blood.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Marjorie begged her husband not to go hunting after the girls alone, and not to take their son if he felt he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to go after them, but she could have saved her breath. He took the shotgun he kept mounted in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mudroom high out of the reach of little hands, and gave Howie the .22 they had been saving for his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">birthday in July. Then they went, neither of them paying the slightest attention to the shrieking, weeping</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman who wanted to know what they would do if they met a gang of wandering hobos or a bunch of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bad niggers escaped from the county farm over in Laduc. In this I think the men were right, you know.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The blood was no longer runny, but it was only tacky yet, and still closer to true red than the maroon that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comes when blood has well dried. The abduction hadn&apos;t happened too long ago. Klaus must have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reasoned that there was still a chance for his girls, and he meant to take it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Neither one of them could track worth a damn - they were gatherers, not hunters, men who went into the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woods after coon and deer in their seasons not because they much wanted to, but because it was an</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected thing. And the dooryard around the house was a blighted patch of dirt with tracks all overlaid in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a meaningless tangle. They went around the barn, and saw almost at once why Bowser, a bad biter but a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y70 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good barker, hadn&apos;t sounded the alarm. He lay half in and half out of a doghouse which had been built of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y71 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leftover barnboards (there was a signboard with the word <span class="ff4">Bowser</span> neatly printed on it over the curved</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y148 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hole in the front - I saw a photograph of it in one of the papers), his head turned most of the way around</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y149 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on his neck. It would have taken a man of enormous power to have done that to such a big animal, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prosecutor later told John Coffey&apos;s jury ... and then he had looked long and meaningfully at the hulking</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">defendant, sitting behind the defense table with his eyes cast down and wearing a brand-new pair of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">state-bought bib overalls that looked like damnation in and of themselves. Beside the dog, Klaus and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Howie found a scrap of cooked link sausage. The theory - a sound one, I have no doubt - was that Coffey</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had first charmed the dog with treats, and then, as Bowser began to eat the last one, had reached out his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands and broken its neck with one mighty snap of his wrists.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y73 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Beyond the barn was Detterick&apos;s north pasture, where no cows would graze that day. It was drenched</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y74 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with morning dew, and leading off through it, cutting on a diagonal to the northwest and plain as day,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y75 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was the beaten track of a man&apos;s passage.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y49 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even in his state of near-hysteria, Klaus Detterick hesitated at first to follow it. It wasn&apos;t fear of the man</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or men who had taken his daughters; it was fear of following the abductor&apos;s backtrail ... of going off in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exactly the wrong direction at a time when every second might count.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Howie solved that dilemma by plucking a shred of yellow cotton cloth from a bush growing just beyond</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y89 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the edge of the dooryard. Klaus was shown this same scrap of cloth as he sat on the witness stand, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to weep as he identified it as a piece of his daughter Kathe&apos;s sleeping-shorts. Twenty yards beyond</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it, hanging from the jutting finger of a juniper shrub, they found a piece of faded green cloth that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y50 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">matched the nightie Cora had been wearing when she kissed her ma and pa goodnight.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Dettericks, father and son, set off at a near-run with their guns held in front of them, as soldiers do</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when crossing contested ground under heavy fire.

The coonies took</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">another sniff, decided to vote the straight ticket, and off they all went downstream, in full cry.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It wasn&apos;t but ten minutes later when the men stopped, realizing they could hear more than just the dogs.

So they said, and I believed them. I think I would have recognized it, too. I have heard men</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scream just that way, I think, on their way to the electric chair. Not a lot - most button themselves up and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go either quiet or joking, like it was the class picnic - but a few. Usually the ones who believe in hell as a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">real place, and know it is waiting for them at the end of the Green Mile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bobo shortleashed his dogs again. They were valuable, and he had no intention of losing them to the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">psychopath howling and gibbering just down yonder. The other men reloaded their guns and snapped</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them closed. That howling had chilled them all, and made the sweat under their arms and running down</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their backs feel like icewater. When men take a chill like that, they need a leader if they are to go on, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Deputy McGee led them. He got out in front and walked briskly (I bet he didn&apos;t <span class="ff4">feel</span> very brisk right then,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though) to a stand of alders that jutted out of the woods on the right, with the rest of them trundling along</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nervously about five paces behind. He paused just once, and that was to motion the biggest man among</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them - Sam Hollis - to keep near Klaus Detterick.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y152 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the other side of the alders there was more open ground stretching back to the woods on the right. On</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the left was the long, gentle slope of the riverbank. They all stopped where they were, thunderstruck. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think they would have given a good deal to unsee what was before them, and none of them would ever</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forget it - it was the sort of nightmare, bald and almost smoking in the sun, that lies beyond the drapes</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y46 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and furnishings of good and ordinary lives - church suppers, walks along country lanes, honest work,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love-kisses in bed. There is a skull in every man, and I tell you there is a skull in the lives of all men.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y48 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They saw it that day, those men - they saw what sometimes grins behind the smile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y85 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sitting on the riverbank in a faded, bloodstained jumper was the biggest man any of them had ever seen -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y86 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey. His enormous, splay-toed feet were bare. On his head he wore a faded red bandanna, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y87 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way a country woman would wear a kerchief into church. Gnats circled him in a black cloud. Curled in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">each arm was the body of a naked girl. Their blonde hair, once curly and light as milkweed fluff, was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y89 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now matted to their heads and streaked red. The man holding them sat bawling up at the sky like a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moonstruck calf, his dark brown cheeks slicked with tears, his face twisted in a monstrous cramp of grief</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He drew breath in hitches, his chest rising until the snaps holding the straps of his jumper were strained,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y50 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and then let that vast catch of air out in another of those howls. So often you read in the paper that &quot;the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y51 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">killer showed no remorse,&quot; but that wasn&apos;t the case here. John Coffey was torn open by what he had done</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y52 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">... but he would live. The girls would not.

It seemed they looked for an hour or for forever, and yet the train</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">got no farther along, it seemed to storm only in one place, like a child doing a tantrum, and the sun did</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not go behind a cloud, and the sight was not blotted from their eyes. It was there before them, as real as a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dogbite. The black man rocked back and forth; Cora and Kathe rocked with him like dolls in the arms of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a giant.

He was six inches taller</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than Klaus and outweighed him by at least seventy pounds, but Klaus seemed to almost shrug his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">encircling arms off. Klaus flew across the intervening open ground and launched a flying kick at Coffey&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">head. His workboot, caked with spilled milk that had already soured in the heat, scored a direct hit on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Coffey&apos;s left temple, but Coffey seemed not to feel it at all. He only sat there, keening and rocking and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looking out across the river; the way I imagine it, he could almost have been a picture out of some piney</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y158 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woods Pentecostal sermon, the faithful follower of the Cross looking out toward Goshen Land ... if not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y159 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the corpses, that was.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It took four men to haul the hysterical farmer off John Coffey, and he fetched Coffey I don&apos;t know how</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many good licks before they finally did. It didn&apos;t seem to matter to Coffey, one way or the other; he just</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y70 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">went on looking out across the river and keening. As for Detterick, all the fight went out of him when he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y71 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was finally pulled off - as if some strange galvanizing current had been running through the huge black</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y148 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man (I still have a tendency to think in electrical metaphors; you&apos;ll have to pardon me), and when</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y149 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Detterick&apos;s contact with that power source was finally broken, he went as limp as a man flung back from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a live wire. He knelt wide-legged on the riverbank with his hands to his face, sobbing. Howie joined him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and they hugged each other forehead to forehead.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two men watched them while the rest formed a rifle-toting ring around the rocking, wailing black man.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He still seemed not to realize that anyone but him was there.

McGee looked at eyes that were bloodshot</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y46 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from crying. And still they streamed, as if someone had left a faucet on inside him. Those eyes wept, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yet were somehow untouched ... distant and serene. I thought them the strangest eyes I had ever seen in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y48 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my life, and McGee felt much the same. &quot;Like the eyes of an animal that never saw a man before,&quot; he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y49 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told a reporter named Hammersmith just before the trial.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y86 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Mister, do you hear me?&quot; McGee asked.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y141 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Slowly, Coffey nodded his head.

It was their hair that was the worst, he said</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">later ... and this wasn&apos;t in any newspaper story; it was considered too grisly for family reading. No, this I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">got from the reporter who wrote the story, Mr. Hammersmith. I looked him up later on, because later on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey became sort of an obsession with me. McGee told this Hammersmith that their blonde hair</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wasn&apos;t blonde anymore. It was auburn. Blood had run down their cheeks out of it like it was a bad</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dye-job, and you didn&apos;t have to be a doctor to see that their fragile skulls had been dashed together with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the force of those mighty arms.

I knew what that was about - there were unwritten but very important rules to the game,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and I had stopped playing by them for awhile yesterday - and so I put it off as long as possible. Like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">going to the doctor about my waterworks problem, I suppose. I&apos;ve always thought this &quot;get-it-over-with&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">business was overrated.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Anyway, I didn&apos;t hurry to Warden Moores&apos;s office. I stripped off my wool uniform coat instead, hung it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the back of my chair, and turned on the fan in the corner - it was another hot one. Then I sat down</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and went over Brutus Howell&apos;s night-sheet. There was nothing there to get alarmed about. Delacroix had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wept briefly after turning in - he did most nights, and more for himself than for the folks he had roasted</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">alive, I am quite sure - and then had take Mr. Jingles, the mouse, out of the cigar box he slept in. That</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had calmed Del, and he had slept like a baby the rest of the night. Mr. Jingles had most likely spent it on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix&apos;s stomach, with his tail curled over his paws, eyes unblinking. It was as if God had decided</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y91 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix needed a guardian angel, but had decreed in His wisdom that only a mouse would do for a rat</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y92 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like our homicidal friend from Louisiana. Not all that was in Brutal&apos;s report, of course, but I had done</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y62 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enough night watches myself to fill in the stuff between the lines. There was a brief note about Coffey:</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y63 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Laid awake, mostly quiet, may have cried some. I tried to get some talk started, but after a few grunted</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y64 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">replies from Coffey, gave up. Paul or Harry may have better luck.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Getting the talk started&quot; was at the center of our job, really. I didn&apos;t know it then, but looking back from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y93 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the vantage point of this strange old age (I think all old ages seem strange to the folk who must endure</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y94 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them), I understand that it was, and why I didn&apos;t see it then - it was too big, as central to our work as our</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y95 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">respiration was to our lives. It wasn&apos;t important that the floaters be good at &quot;getting the talk started,&quot; but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y96 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it was vital for me and Harry and Brutal and Dean... and it was one reason why Percy Wetmore was such</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y97 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a disaster. The inmates hated him, the guards hated him ... everyone hated him, presumably, except for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y98 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his political connections, Percy himself, and maybe (but only maybe) his mother. He was like a dose of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y85 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">white arsenic sprinkled into a wedding cake, and I think I knew he spelled disaster the start. He was an</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y86 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accident waiting to happen. As for the rest of us, we would have scoffed at the idea that we functioned</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y87 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">most usefully not as the guards of the condemned but as their psychiatrists part of me still wants to scoff</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at that idea today - but we knew about getting the talk started . . . and without the talk, men facing Old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y89 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sparky had a nasty habit of going insane.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y154 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I made a note at the bottom of Brutal&apos;s report to talk to John Coffey - to try, at least - and then passed on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y155 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to a note from Curtis Anderson, the warden&apos;s chief assistant.

Has rambled all over the state</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the last year or so, and has hit the big time at last. Killed three people in a holdup, one a pregnant</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman, killed a fourth in the getaway. State Patrolman. All he missed was a nun and a blind man!&apos; I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smiled a little at that. &quot;Wharton is 19 years old, has <span class="ff4">Billy the Kid</span> tattooed on upper l. forearm. You will</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y168 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have to slap his nose a time or two, I guarantee you that, but be careful when you do it. This man just</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y169 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doesn&apos;t care.&quot; He had underlined this last sentiment twice, then finished: &quot;Also, he may be a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y16a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hang-arounder. He&apos;s working appeals, and there&apos;s the fact that he is a minor.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y16b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A crazy kid, working appeals, apt to be around for awhile. Oh, that all sounded just fine. Suddenly the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y16c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day seemed hotter than ever, and I could no longer put off seeing Warden Moores.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y16d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I worked for three wardens during my years as a Cold Mountain guard; Hal Moores was the last and best</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y16e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of them. In a walk. Honest, straightforward, lacking even Curtis Anderson&apos;s rudimentary wit, but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y16f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">equipped with just enough political savvy to keep his job during those grim years ... and enough integrity</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y170 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to keep from getting seduced by the game. He would not rise any higher, but that seemed all right with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y171 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. He was fifty-eight or -nine back then, with a deeply lined bloodhound face that Bobo Marchant</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y172 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">probably would have felt right at home with. He had white hair and his hands shook with some sort of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y173 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">palsy, but he was strong. The year before, when a prisoner had rushed him in the exercise yard with a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y174 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shank whittled out of a crate-slat, Moores had stood his ground, grabbed the skatehound&apos;s wrist, and had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y175 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">twisted it so hard that the snapping bones had sounded like dry twigs burning in a hot fire. The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y176 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">skatehound, all his grievances forgotten, had gone down on his knees in the dirt and begun screaming for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y177 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his mother. &quot;I&apos;m not her,&quot; Moores said in his cultured Southern voice, &quot;But if I was, I&apos;d raise up my skirts</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y178 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and piss on you from the loins that gave you birth.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y179 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When I came into his office, he started to get up and I waved him back down. I took the seat across the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y17a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">desk from him, and began by asking about his wife ... except in our part of the world, that&apos;s not how you</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y17b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do it. &quot;How&apos;s that pretty gal of yours&quot; is what I asked, as if Melinda had seen only seventeen summers</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y17c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">instead of sixty-two or -three. My concern was genuine he was a woman I could have loved and married</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y17d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">myself, if the lines of our lives had coincided - but I didn&apos;t mind diverting him a little from his main</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y17e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">business, either.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y17f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He sighed deeply. &quot;Not so well, Paul.

And now she&apos;s developed this weakness in her right hand-&quot; He raised his own liverspotted</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y183 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right hand. We both watched it tremble above his blotter for a moment or two, and then he lowered it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y184 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again. I could tell he would have given just about anything not to be telling me what he was telling me,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y185 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and I would have given just about anything not to be hearing it. Melinda&apos;s headaches had started in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y186 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spring, and all that summer her doctor had been saying they were &quot;nervous-tension migraines,&quot; perhaps</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y187 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">caused by the stress of Hal&apos;s coming retirement. Except that neither of them could wait for his retirement,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y188 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and my own wife had told me that migraine is not a disease of the old but the young; by the time its</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y189 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sufferers reached Melinda Moores&apos;s age, they were usually getting better, not worse. And now this</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weakness of the hand. It didn&apos;t sound like nervous tension to me; it sounded like a damned stroke.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Paul, the governor is so married he&apos;s almost not there, if you take my meaning.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And his wife has a brother who has one child. That child is Percy Wetmore. Percy called his dad last</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night, and Percy&apos;s dad called Percy&apos;s aunt. Do I have to trace the rest of this out for you?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&apos;No,&quot; I said. &quot;Percy squealed. Just like the schoolroom sissy telling teacher he saw Jack and Jill</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smooching in the cloakroom.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yep,&quot; Moores agreed, &quot;that&apos;s about the size of it.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You know what happened between Percy and Delacroix when Delacroix came in?&quot; I asked. &quot;Percy and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yef ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his damned hickory billy-club?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, but - &quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;And you know how he runs it along the bars sometimes, just for the pure hell of it. He&apos;s mean, and he&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stupid, and I don&apos;t know how much longer I can take him. That&apos;s the truth.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We&apos;d known each other five years. That can be a long time for men who get on well, especially when part</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the job is trading life for death. What I&apos;m saying is that he understood what I meant. Not that I would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quit; not with the Depression walking around outside the prison walls like a dangerous criminal, one that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">couldn&apos;t be caged as our charges were. Better men than me were out on the roads or riding the rods. I was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y163 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lucky and knew it - children grown and the mortgage, that two-hundred-pound block of marble, had been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off my chest for the last two years. But a man&apos;s got to eat, and his wife has to eat, too. Also, we were</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y119 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used to sending our daughter and son-in-law twenty bucks whenever we could afford it (and sometimes</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y190 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when we couldn&apos;t, if Jane&apos;s letters sounded particularly desperate). He was an out-of-work high-school</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y191 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teacher, and if that didn&apos;t qualify for desperate back in those days, then the word had no meaning. So no,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y192 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you didn&apos;t walk off a steady paycheck job like mine ... not in cold blood, that was. But my blood wasn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y193 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cold that fall. The temperatures outside were unseasonable, and the infection crawling around inside me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y194 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had turned the thermostat up even more. And when a man&apos;s in that kind of situation, why, sometimes his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fist flies out pretty much of its own accord. And if you slug a connected man like Percy Wetmore once,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y195 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you might as well just go right on slugging, because there&apos;s no going back.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

At last I was able to get it up where it belonged so I could talk. &quot;What</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are you saying?

In fact, Hal, he&apos;s almost <span class="ff4">bound</span> to screw up. And in front of thirty or so</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">witnesses ... reporters all the way up from Louisiana . . .&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y198 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You and Brutus Howell will make sure he doesn&apos;t,&quot; Moores said. &quot;And if he does anyway, it goes on his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">record, and it&apos;ll still be there long after his statehouse connections are gone. You understand?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I did. It made me feel sick and scared, but I did.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y199 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He may want to stay for Coffey, but if we&apos;re lucky, he&apos;ll get all he needs from Delacroix.

I nodded. I had the sense to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know it was a gamble I was taking, but I didn&apos;t care. If it would get rid of Percy Wetmore, I&apos;d tweak the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">devil&apos;s nose. He could take part in his execution, clamp on the cap, and then look through the grille and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tell Van Hay to roll on two; he could watch the little Frenchman ride the lightning that he, Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wetmore, had let out of the bottle. Let him have his nasty little thrill, if that&apos;s what state-sanctioned</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">murder was to him.

I was happy to go. All in all, I felt</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as if I&apos;d gotten off easy. And it was nice to know there was a chance of surviving Percy, after all.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You send Melinda a whole basket of my love,&quot; I said. &quot;And don&apos;t go buying you an extra crate of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trouble, either. It&apos;ll probably turn out to be nothing but migraine, after all.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You bet,&quot; he said, and below his sick eyes, his lips smiled. The combination was damned near ghoulish.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As for me, I went back to E Block to start another day. There was paperwork to be read and written, there</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were floors to be mopped, there were meals to be served, a duty roster to be made out for the following</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">week, there were a hundred details to be seen to. But mostly there was waiting - in prison there&apos;s always</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plenty of that, so much it never gets done. Waiting for Eduard Delacroix to walk the Green Mile, waiting</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for William Wharton to arrive with his curled lip and Billy the Kid tattoo, and, most of all, waiting for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1aa ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy Wetmore to be gone out of my life.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 y1ab ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ac ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix&apos;s mouse was one of God&apos;s mysteries.

Delacroix</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">claimed that he trained that mouse, which started its life among us as Steamboat Willy, but I really think</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ae ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it was the other way around. Dean Stanton felt the same way, and so did Brutal. Both of them were there</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the night the mouse put in its first appearance, and as Brutal said, &quot;The thing &apos;us half-tame already, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">twice as smart as that Cajun what thought he owned it.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1af ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean and I were in my office, going over the record-box for the last year, getting ready to write</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">follow-up letters to witnesses of five executions, and to write follow-ups to follow-ups in another six</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stretching all the way back to &apos;29. Basically, we wanted to know just one thing: were they pleased with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the service? I know it sounds grotesque, but it was an important consideration. As taxpayers they were</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our customers, but very special ones. A man or a woman who will turn out at midnight to watch a man</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">die has got a special, pressing reason to be there, a special need, and if execution is a proper punishment,</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

They&apos;ve had a nightmare. The purpose of the execution is to show</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them that the nightmare is over. Maybe it even works that way. Sometimes.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y54 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Hey!&quot; Brutal called from outside the door, where he was manning the desk at the head of the hall. &quot;Hey,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you two! Get out here!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean and I gazed at each other with identical expressions of alarm, thinking that something had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happened to either the Indian from Oklahoma (his name was Arlen Bitterbuck, but we called him The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chief ... or, in Harry Terwilliger&apos;s case, Chief Coat Cheese, because that was what Harry claimed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bitterbuck smelled like), or the fellow we called The President. But then Brutal started to laugh, and we</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hurried to see what was happening. Laughing in E Block sounded almost as wrong as laughing in church.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Old Toot-Toot, the trusty who ran the food-wagon in those days, had been by with his holy-rolling</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cartful of goodies, and Brutal had stocked up for a long night - three sandwiches, two pops, and a couple</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of moon pies. Also a side of potato salad Toot had undoubtedly filched from the prison kitchen, which</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was supposed to be off-limits to him. Brutal had the logbook open in front of him, and for a wonder he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hadn&apos;t spilled anything on it yet. Of course, he was just getting started.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&apos;What?&quot; Dean asked. &quot;What is it?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;State legislature must have opened the pursestrings enough to hire another screw this year after all,&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal said, still laughing. &quot;Lookie yonder.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He pointed and we saw the mouse. I started to laugh, too, and Dean joined in. You really couldn&apos;t help it,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because a guard doing quarter-hour check rounds was just like that mouse looked like: a tiny, furry guard</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">making sure no one was trying to escape or commit suicide. It would trot a little way toward us along the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Green Mile, then turn its head from side to side, as if checking the cells. Then it would make another</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forward spurt. The fact that we could hear both of our current inmates snoring away in spite of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yelling and the laughter somehow made it even funnier.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was a perfectly ordinary brown mouse, except for the way it seemed to be checking into the cells. It</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even went into one or two of them, skipping nimbly in between the lower bars in a way I imagine many</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of our inmates, past and present, would envy. Except it was out that the cons would always be wanting to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">skip, of course.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The mouse didn&apos;t go into either of the occupied cells; only the empties. And finally it had worked its way</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">almost up to where we were. I kept expecting it to turn back, but it didn&apos;t. It showed no fear of us at all.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It ain&apos;t normal for a mouse to come up on people that way,&quot; Dean said, a little nervously. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rabid.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oh, my Christ,&quot; Brutal said through a mouthful of corned-beef sandwich. &quot;The big mouse expert.

I couldn&apos;t see its mouth, either,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y192 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I could see the dark little drops that were its eyes, and they didn&apos;t look crazy or rabid to me.

But the way he ate it fascinated us all. He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">approached the fragment of sandwich, sniffed his way around it, and then he sat up in front of it like a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dog doing a trick, grabbed it, and pulled the bread apart to get at the meat. He did it as deliberately and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knowingly as a man tucking into a good roast-beef dinner in his favorite restaurant. I never saw an</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">animal eat like that, not even a well-trained house dog.

Then it turned and scurried off the way it had come, not pausing to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do any cell-checks this time.

Also in the restraint room was the jacket no one</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted to wear - white, made of double-sewn canvas, and with the buttons and snaps and buckles going</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up the back. We all knew how to zip a problem child into that jacket lickety-larrup. They didn&apos;t get</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y158 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">violent often, our lost boys, but when they did, brother, you didn&apos;t wait around for the situation to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y159 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">improve on its own.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal reached into the desk drawer above the kneehole and brought out the big leather-bound book with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the word VISITORS stamped on the front in gold leaf. Ordinarily, that book stayed in the drawer from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y70 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one month to the next. When a prisoner had visitors - unless it was a lawyer or a minister - he went over</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y71 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the room off the messhall that was kept special for that purpose.

He took the pencil and licked the tip - a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y152 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disagreeable habit of which he could not be broken - and prepared to write. Regulation 19 stated simply:</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Each visitor to E Block shall show a yellow Administration pass and shall be recorded <span class="ff4">without </span>fail&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y94 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He&apos;s gone nuts,&quot; Dean said to me.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He didn&apos;t show us his pass, but I&apos;m gonna let it go this time,&quot; Brutal said. He gave the tip of his pencil an</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">extra lick for good luck, then filled in 9:49 p.m. under the column headed TIME ON BLOCK.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Sure, why not, the big bosses probably make exceptions for mice,&quot; I said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Course they do,&quot; Brutal agreed. &quot;Lack of pockets.&quot; He turned to look at the wall-clock behind the desk,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then printed 10:01 in the column headed TIME OFF BLOCK. The longer space between these two</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">numbers was headed NAME OF VISITOR.

Better to kill the scout, no matter how</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">amusing it might be, than have to live with the pilgrims. And, I shouldn&apos;t have to tell you, neither of us</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was very squeamish about a little mouse-murder.

There was a great deal of junk,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">too, more than I would have expected, because we hadn&apos;t had to use the restraint room in a long time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That would change with the advent of William Wharton, but of course we didn&apos;t know that at the time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lucky us.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Where&apos;d it go?&quot; Brutal asked at last, wiping sweat off the back of his neck with a big blue bandanna.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No hole, no crack ... there&apos;s that, but - &quot; He pointed to the drain in the floor.

The door was open, and I saw our mop-bucket inside. The floor, that same sick lime shade</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as the Green Mile itself, was drying in streaks.

He&apos;d pull it out of that ridiculous handtooled</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">holster he&apos;d gotten somewhere, then twirl it (or try to; most times he would have dropped it if not for the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rawhide loop he kept on his wrist), then re-holster it. I was off that night, but got the full report from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean the following evening.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The mouse came up the Green Mile just as it had before, hopping along, then stopping and seeming to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">check the empty cells. After a bit of that it would hop on, undiscouraged, as if it had known all along it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be a long search, and it was up to that.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The President was awake this time, standing at his cell door. That guy was a piece of work, managing to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">look natty even in his prison blues. We knew just by the way he looked that he wasn&apos;t made for Old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y200 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sparky, and we were right - less than a week after Percy&apos;s second run at that mouse, The Pres&apos;s sentence</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was commuted to life and he joined the general population.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y201 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Say!&quot; he called. &apos;&apos;There&apos;s a mouse in here! What kind of a joint are you guys running, anyway?&quot; He was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kind of laughing, but Dean said he also sounded kind of outraged, as if even a murder rap hadn&apos;t been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y203 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quite enough to knock the Kiwanis out of his soul. He had been the regional head of an outfit called</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mid-South Realty Associates, and had thought himself smart enough to be able to get away with pushing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his half-senile father out a third-story window and collect on a double-indemnity whole-life policy. On</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he had been wrong, but maybe not by much.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Shut up, you lugoon,&quot; Percy said, but that was pretty much automatic.

And Percy standing there the whole time, tapping and tapping, not talking for a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">change, wanting to make it sorry for coming back. Wanting to teach it a lesson.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Good thing you guys don&apos;t have to put him in Sparky,&quot; Bill said, interested in spite of himself. &quot;You&apos;d</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have a hell of a time getting the clamps and the cap on.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy said nothing still, but he very slowly gripped the baton between his fingers, the way a man would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y208 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hold a good cigar.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The mouse stopped where it had before, no more than three feet from the duty desk, looking up at Dean</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like a prisoner before the bar. It glanced up at Bill for a moment, then switched its attention back to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean. Percy it hardly seemed to notice at all.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y209 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He&apos;s a brave little barstid, I got to give him that,&quot; Bill said.

The mouse sniffed but did not touch.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Huh,&quot; Bill said. &quot;Must be full.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Nah,&quot; Dean said, &quot;he knows you&apos;re a floater, that&apos;s all.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y216 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Floater, am I? I like that! I&apos;m here almost as much as Harry Terwilliger! Maybe more!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y217 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Simmer down, old-timer, simmer down,&quot; Dean said, grinning. &quot;But watch and see if I&apos;m not right.&quot; He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y218 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bombed another piece of cracker over the side. Sure enough, the mouse picked that one up and began to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1dc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eat again, still ignoring Bill Dodge&apos;s contribution completely. But before it had done more than take a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preliminary nibble or two, Percy threw his baton at it, launching it like a spear.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y205 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The mouse was a small target, and give the devil his due-it was a wickedly good shot, and might have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taken &quot;Willy&apos;s&quot; head clean off, if its reflexes hadn&apos;t been as sharp as shards of broken glass. It ducked -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yes, just as a human being would have - and dropped the chunk of cracker. The heavy hickory baton</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y100 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">passed over its head and spine close enough so its fur ruffled (that&apos;s what Dean said, anyway, and so I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y101 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pass it on, although I&apos;m not sure I really believe it), then hit the green linoleum and bounced against the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bars of an empty cell. The mouse didn&apos;t wait to see if it was a mistake; apparently remembering a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pressing engagement elsewhere, it turned and was off down the corridor toward the restraint room in a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flash.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy roared with frustration - he knew how close he had come - and chased after it again. Bill Dodge</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grabbed at his arm, probably out of simple instinct, but Percy pulled away from him. Still, Dean said, it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was probably that grab which saved Steamboat Willy&apos;s life, and it was still a near thing. Percy wanted not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just to kill the mouse but to <span class="ff4">squash</span> it, so he ran in big, comical leaps, like a deer, stamping down with his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heavy black workshoes. The mouse barely avoided Percy&apos;s last two jumps, first zigging and then zagging.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y219 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It went under the door with a final flick of its long pink tail, and so long, stranger - it was gone.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Fuck!&quot;<span class="ff3"> Percy said, and slammed the flat of his hand against the door. Then he began to sort through his</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keys, meaning to go into the restraint room and continue the chase.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean came down the corridor after him, deliberately walking slow in order to get his emotions under</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">control. Part of him wanted to laugh at Percy, he told me, but part of him wanted to grab the man, whirl</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him around, pin him against the restraint-room door, and whale the living daylights out of him. Most of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it, of course, was just being startled; our job on E Block was to keep rumpus to a minimum, and rumpus</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was practically Percy Wetmore&apos;s middle name. Working with him was sort of like trying to defuse a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bomb with somebody standing behind you and every now and then clashing a pair of cymbals together.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In a word, upsetting. Dean said he could see that upset in Arlen Bitterbucks eyes ... even in The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">President&apos;s eyes, although that gentleman was usually as cool as the storied cucumber.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And there was something else, as well. In some part of his mind, Dean had already begun to accept the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse as - well, maybe not as a friend, but as a part of life on the block. That made what Percy had done</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y203 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and what he was trying to do not right. Not even if it was a mouse he was trying to do it to. And the fact</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Percy would never understand how come it wasn&apos;t right was pretty much the perfect example of why</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was all wrong for the job he thought he was doing.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By the time Dean reached the end of the corridor, he had gotten himself under control again, and knew</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how he wanted to handle the matter. The one thing Percy absolutely couldn&apos;t stand was to look foolish,</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

The Chief and The Pres, too.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y205 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;ll be damned if I understand what&apos;s so funny,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t need mice in the cellblock - we got</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enough vermin in here already, without adding mice.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Whatever you say, Percy,&quot; Dean said, holding up his hands.

Threw two no-hitters.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Is that right, now?&quot; Bill said, and the respectful tone of voice (although he winked at Dean when Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y208 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turned away) was enough to finish defusing the situation.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yep,&quot; Percy said. &quot;Threw one down in Knoxville. Those city boys didn&apos;t know what hit em. Walked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two. Could have had a perfect game if the ump hadn&apos;t been such a lugoon.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean could have left it at that, but he had seniority on Percy and part of a senior&apos;s job is to instruct, and at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y209 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that time - before Coffey, before Delacroix - he still thought Percy might be teachable. So he reached out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1db ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and grasped the younger man&apos;s wrist. &quot;You want to think about what you was doing just now,&quot; Dean</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ab ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said.

The Chief, if given a chance,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">might have administered such a beating just to teach Percy a lesson. What Dean said to me on that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y107 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">subject when he told me this story the following night has stuck with me ever since, because it turned out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be a kind of prophecy. &quot;Wetmore don&apos;t understand that he hasn&apos;t got any power over them,&quot; Dean said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That nothing he does can really make things worse for them, that they can only be electrocuted once.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Until he gets his head around that, he&apos;s going to be a danger to himself and to everyone else down here.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y108 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy went into my office and slammed the door behind him.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;My, my,&quot; Bill Dodge said. &quot;Ain&apos;t he the swollen and badly infected testicle.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1df ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You don&apos;t know the half of it,&quot; Dean said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oh, look on the bright side,&quot; Bill said. He was always telling people to look on the bright side; it got so</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y223 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you wanted to punch his nose every time it came out of his mouth. &quot;Your trick mouse got away, at least.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yeah, but we won&apos;t see him no more,&quot; Dean said. &quot;I imagine this time goddam Percy Wetmore&apos;s scared</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him off for good.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 y224 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y225 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That was logical but wrong.

I was there to see his reappearance; so was Dean.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y227 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry Terwilliger, too. Harry was on the desk. I was technically on days, but had stuck around to spend</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an extra hour with The Chief, whose time was getting close by then. Bitterbuck was stoical on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outside, in the tradition of his tribe, but I could see his fear of the end growing inside him like a poison</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

You could talk to them in the daytime but it wasn&apos;t so good, with the shouts and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conversation (not to mention the occasional fist-fight) coming from the exercise yard, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chonk-chonk-chonk of the stamping machines in the plate-shop, the occasional yell of a guard for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">someone to put down that pick or grab up that hoe or just to get your ass over here, Harvey. After four it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">got a little better, and after six it got better still. Six to eight was the optimum time. After that you could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see the long thoughts starting to steal over their minds again - in their eyes you could see it, like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">afternoon shadows and it was best to stop. They still heard what you were saying, but it no longer made</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y81 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sense to them. Past eight they were getting ready for the watches of the night and imagining how the cap</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y82 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would feel when it was clamped to the tops of their heads, and how the air would smell inside the black</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y228 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bag which had been rolled down over their sweaty faces.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But I got The Chief at a good time. He told me about his first wife, and how they had built a lodge</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together up in Montana. Those had been the happiest days of his life, he said. The water was so pure and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so cold that it felt like your mouth was cut every time you drank.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Hey, Mr. Edgecombe,&quot; he said. &quot;You think, if a man he sincerely repent of what he done wrong, he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">might get to go back to the time that was happiest for him and live there forever? Could that be what</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heaven is like?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y60 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;ve just about believed that very thing,&quot; I said, which was a he I didn&apos;t regret in the least. I had learned</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of matters eternal at my mother&apos;s pretty knee, and what I believed is what the Good Book says about</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">murderers: that there is no eternal life in them. I think they go straight to hell, where they burn in torment</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until God finally gives Gabriel the nod to blow the Judgment Trump. When he does, they&apos;ll wink out ...</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and probably glad to go they will be. But I never gave a hint of such beliefs to Bitterbuck, or to any of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. I think in their hearts they knew it. Where is your brother, his blood crieth to me from the ground,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God said to Cain, and I doubt if the words were much of a surprise to that particular problem-child; I bet</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he heard Abel&apos;s blood whining out of the earth at him with each step he took.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y64 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Chief was smiling when I left, perhaps thinking about his lodge in Montana and his wife lying</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y152 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bare-breasted in the light of the fire. He would be walking in a warmer fire soon, I had no doubt.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y93 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I went back up the corridor, and Dean told me about his set-to with Percy the previous night. I think he&apos;d</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y94 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waited around just so he could, and I listened carefully. I always listened carefully when the subject was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y95 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy, because I agreed with Dean a hundred per cent - I thought Percy was the sort of man who could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y96 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause a lot of trouble, as much for the rest of us as for himself.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Dean was finishing, old Toot-Toot came by with his red snack-wagon, which was covered with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">handlettered Bible quotes (&quot;REPENT for the LORD shall judge his people,&quot; Deut. 32:36, &quot;And surely</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">your BLOOD of your lives will I require,&quot; Gen. 9:5, and similar cheery, uplifting sentiments), and sold</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y140 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us some sandwiches and pops.

I&apos;ve seen lots of jailhouse movies over the years</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where the official phone rings just as they&apos;re getting ready to pull the switch on some poor innocent sap,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but ours never rang during all my years on E Block, never once. In the movies, salvation is cheap. So is</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">innocence. You pay a quarter, and a quarter&apos;s worth is just what you get. Real life costs more, and most</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the answers are different.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We had a tailor&apos;s dummy down in the tunnel for the run to the meatwagon, and we had Old Toot-Toot for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the rest. Over the years, Toot had somehow become the traditional stand-in for the condemned, as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time-honored in his way as the goose you sit down to on Christmas, whether you like goose or not. Most</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the other screws liked him, were amused by his funny accent - also French, but Canadian rather than</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cajun, and softened into its own thing by his years of incarceration in the South. Even Brutal got a kick</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y91 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of Old Toot. Not me, though. I thought he was, in his way, an older and dimmer version of Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y92 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wetmore, a man too squeamish to kill and cook his own meat but who did, all the same, just love the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y62 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smell of a barbecue.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We were all there for the rehearsal, just as we would all be there for the main event. Brutus Howell had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been &quot;put out,&quot; as we said, which meant that he would place the cap, monitor the governor&apos;s phoneline,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">summon the doctor from his place by the wall if he was needed, and give the actual order to roll on two</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y93 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when the time came. If it went well, there would be no credit for anyone. If it didn&apos;t go well, Brutal</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y94 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be blamed by the witnesses and I would be blamed by the warden. Neither of us complained about</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y95 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this; it wouldn&apos;t have done any good. The world turns, that&apos;s all. You can hold on and turn with it, or</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y96 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand up to protest and be spun right off.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean, Harry Terwilliger, and I walked down to The Chief&apos;s cell for the first rehearsal not three minutes</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after Bill and his troops had escorted Bitterbuck off the block and over to the Arcade.

The folding wooden chairs, about forty of them, were</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y239 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already in place. Bitterbuck would cross to the platform on an angle that would keep him safely away</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the seated spectators, and half a dozen guards would be added for insurance. Bill Dodge would be</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in charge of those. We had never had a witness menaced by a condemned prisoner in spite of what was,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">admittedly, a raw set-up, and that was how I meant to keep it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Ready, boys?&quot; Toot asked when we were back in our original formation at the foot of the stairs leading</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down from my office. I nodded, and we walked to the platform. What we looked like more than</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything, I often thought, was a color-guard that had forgotten its flag.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y240 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What am I supposed to do?&quot; Percy called from behind the wire mesh between the storage room and the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y241 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">switch room.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y242 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Watch and learn,&quot; I called back.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y243 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;And keep yer hands off yer wiener,&quot; Harry muttered. Toot-Toot heard him, though, and cackled.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y244 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We escorted him up onto the platform and Toot turned around on his own - the old vet in action. &quot;Sittin</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y245 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down,&quot; he said, &quot;sittin down. sittin down, takin a seat in Old Sparky&apos;s lap.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1e8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I dropped to my right knee before his right leg. Dean dropped to his left knee before his left leg. It was at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y246 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this point we ourselves would be most vulnerable to physical attack, should the condemned man go</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">berserk, which, every now and then, they did. We both turned the cocked knee slightly inward, to protect</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1eb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the crotch area. We dropped our chins to protect our throats. And, of course, we moved to secure the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y247 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ankles and neutralize the danger as fast as we could. The Chief would be wearing slippers when he took</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y248 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his final promenade, but &quot;it could have been worse&quot; isn&apos;t much comfort to a man with a ruptured larynx.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y249 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Or writhing on the floor with his balls swelling up to the size of Mason jars, for that matter, while forty</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y24a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or so spectators - many of them gentlemen of the press - sit in those Grange-hall chairs, watching the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y24b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole thing.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y24c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We clamped Toot-Toot&apos;s ankles. The clamp on Dean&apos;s side was slightly bigger, because it carried the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1f2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">juice. When Bitterbuck sat down tomorrow night, he would do so with a shaved left calf. Indians have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y24d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">very little body-hair as a rule, but we would take no chances.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1f4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While we were clamping Toot-Toots ankles, Brutal secured his right wrist. Harry stepped smoothly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y24e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forward and clamped the left. When they were done, Harry nodded to Brutal, and Brutal called back to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1f6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Van Hay: &quot;Roll on one!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y24f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I heard Percy asking Jack Van Hay what that meant (it was hard to believe how little he knew, how little</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y250 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he&apos;d picked up during his time on E Block) and Van Hay&apos;s murmur of explanation. Today Roll on <span class="ff4">one</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y251 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meant nothing, but when he heard Brutal say it tomorrow night, Van Hay would turn the knob that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1fa ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">goosed the prison generator behind B Block. The witnesses would hear the genny as a steady low</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1fb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">humming, and the lights all over the prison would brighten. In the other cellblocks, prisoners would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y252 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">observe those overbright lights and think it had happened, the execution was over, when in fact it was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y253 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just beginning.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y254 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal stepped around the chair so that Toot could see him. &quot;Arlen Bitterbuck, you have been condemned</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y255 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to die in the electric chair, sentence passed by a jury of your peers and imposed by a judge in good</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y256 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing in this state.

Even Jack Van Hay, a man not known for his sense of humor, was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laughing. I felt like it myself, of course I did, but controlled it somehow.

Still, the important thing was that the laughing fit had passed. That was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y108 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good, because the last thing I wanted was somebody remembering Toot&apos;s smart-aleck remark tomorrow</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night and getting going again.

He got his braids</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrong - his hands were shaking too badly to make a good job of it - and his eldest daughter, a woman of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thirty-odd, was allowed to plait them nice and even. She wanted to weave feathers in at the tips, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pinfeathers of a hawk, his bird, but I couldn&apos;t allow it. They might catch fire and burn. I didn&apos;t tell her</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that, of course, just said it was against regulations. She made no protest, only bowed her head and put her</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands to her temples to show her disappointment and her disapproval. She conducted herself with great</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dignity, that woman, and by doing so practically guaranteed that her father would do the same.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Chief left his cell with no protest or holding back when the time came. Sometimes we had to pry</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their fingers off the bars - I broke one or two in my time and have never forgotten the muffled snapping</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sound - but The Chief wasn&apos;t one of those, thank God. He walked strong up the Green Mile to my office,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and there he dropped to his knees to pray with Brother Schuster, who had driven down from the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Heavenly Light Baptist Church in his flivver. Schuster gave The Chief a few psalms, and The Chief</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">started to cry when Schuster got to the one about lying down beside the still waters. It wasn&apos;t bad,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though, no hysteria, nothing like that. I had an idea he was thinking about still water so pure and so cold</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it felt like it was cutting your mouth every time you drank some.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y200 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Actually, I like to see them cry a little.

That was the only time Bitterbuck</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faltered.

Then he took one of the braids his daughter had made</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and kissed it. I looked to Brutal, standing at parade rest behind the chair, resplendent in his best blue</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uniform, all the buttons on the tunic polished and gleaming, his hat sitting square-john perfect on his big</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">head. I gave him a little nod and he shot it right back, stepping forward to help Bitterbuck mount the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">platform if he needed help. Turned out he didn&apos;t.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was less than a minute from the time Bitterbuck sat down in the chair to the moment when Brutal</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">,called &quot;Roll on two!&quot; softly back over his shoulder. The lights dimmed down again, but only a little; you</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wouldn&apos;t have noticed it if you hadn&apos;t been looking for it. That meant Van Hay had pulled the switch</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some wit had labeled MABEL&apos;S HAIR DRIER. There was a low humming from the cap, and Bitterbuck</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surged forward against the clamps and the restraining belt across his chest. Over against the wall, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prison doctor watched expressionlessly, lips thinned until his mouth looked like a single white stitch.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was no flopping and flailing, such as Old Toot-Toot had done at rehearsal, only that powerful</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y60 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forward surge, as a man may surge forward from the hips while in the grip of a powerful orgasm. The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chief&apos;s blue shirt pulled tight at the buttons, creating little strained smiles of flesh between them.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And there was a smell. Not bad in itself, but unpleasant in its associations. I&apos;ve never been able to go</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down in the cellar at my granddaughter&apos;s house when they bring me there, although that&apos;s where their</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y91 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little boy has his Lionel set-up, which he would dearly love to share with his great-grampa. I don&apos;t mind</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y92 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the trains, as I&apos;m sure you can guess - it&apos;s the transformer I can&apos;t abide. The way it hums. And the way,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y62 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when it gets hot, it smells. Even after all these years, that smell reminds me of Cold Mountain.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Van Hay gave him thirty seconds, then turned the juice off. The doctor stepped forward from his place</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and listened with his stethoscope. There was no talk from the witnesses now. The doctor straightened up</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and looked through the mesh. &quot;Disorganized,&quot; he said, and made a twirling, cranking gesture with one</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y93 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finger. He had heard a few random heartbeats from Bitterbuck&apos;s chest, probably as meaningless as the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y94 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">final jitters of a decapitated chicken, but it was better not to take chances. You didn&apos;t want him suddenly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y95 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sitting up on the gurney when you had him halfway through the tunnel, bawling that he felt like he was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y96 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on fire.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Van Hay rolled on three and The Chief surged forward again, twisting a little from side to side in the grip</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the current. When doc listened this time, he nodded. It was over. We had once again succeeded in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">destroying what we could not create. Some of the folks in the audience had begun talking in those low</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y140 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voices again; most sat with their heads down, looking at the floor, as if stunned. Or ashamed.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry and Dean came up with the stretcher. It was actually Percy&apos;s job to take one end, but he didn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y160 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know and no one had bothered to tell him. The Chief, still wearing the black silk hood, was loaded onto</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y143 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it by Brutal and me, and we whisked him through the door which led to the tunnel as fast as we could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manage it without actually running. Smoke - too much of it - was rising from the hole in the top of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y161 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mask, and there was a horrible stench.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y146 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Aw, man!&quot; Percy cried, his voice wavering. &apos;What&apos;s that smell?&quot;</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

It was one of the old chemical kind that you had to pump. Dean,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meanwhile, had stripped off the hood. It wasn&apos;t as bad as it could have been; Bitterbuck&apos;s left braid was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smouldering like a pile of wet leaves.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Never mind that thing,&quot; I told Brutal.

I slapped at The Chief&apos;s head (Percy staring</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at me, wide-eyed, the whole time) until the smoke quit rising. Then we carried the body down the twelve</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wooden steps to the tunnel. Here it was as chilly and dank as a dungeon, with the hollow plink-plink</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sound of dripping water. Hanging lights with crude tin shades - they were made in the prison</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">machine-shop - showed a brick tube that ran thirty feet under the highway. The top was curved and wet.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It made me feel like a character in an Edgar Allan Poe story every time I used it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was a gurney waiting. We loaded Bitterbuck&apos;s body onto it, and I made a final check to make sure</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his hair was out. That one braid was pretty well charred, and I was sorry to see that the cunning little bow</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on that side of his head was now nothing but a blackened lump.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy slapped the dead man&apos;s cheek. The flat smacking sound of his hand made us all jump. Percy looked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">around at us with a cocky smile on his mouth, eyes glittering. Then he looked back at Bitterbuck again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y60 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Adios, Chief,&quot; he said. &quot;Hope hell&apos;s hot enough for you.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t do that,&quot; Brutal said, his voice hollow and declamatory in the dripping tunnel. &quot;He&apos;s paid what he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">owed. He&apos;s square with the house again. You keep your hands off him.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Aw, blow it out,&quot; Percy said, but he stepped back uneasily when Brutal moved toward him, shadow</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rising behind him like the shadow of that ape in the story about the Rue Morgue. But instead of grabbing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at Percy, Brutal grabbed hold of the gurney and began pushing Arlen Bitterbuck slowly toward the far</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end of the tunnel, where his last ride was waiting, parked on the soft shoulder of the highway. The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gurney&apos;s hard rubber wheels moaned on the boards; its shadow rode the bulging brick wall, waxing and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waning; Dean and Harry grasped the sheet at the foot and pulled it up over The Chief&apos;s face, which had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already begun to take on the waxy, characterless cast of all dead faces, the innocent as well as the guilty.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 y66 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">6.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When I was eighteen, my Uncle Paul - the man I was named for - died of a heart attack. My mother and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dad took me to Chicago with them to attend his funeral and visit relatives from my father&apos;s side of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family, many of whom I had never met. We were gone almost a month. In some ways that was a good</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trip, a necessary and exciting trip, but in another way it was horrible. I was deeply in love, you see, with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the young woman who was to become my wife two weeks after my nineteenth birthday. One night when</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my longing for her was like a fire burning out of control in my heart and my head (oh yes, all right, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in my balls, as well), I wrote her a letter that just seemed to go on and on - I poured out my whole heart</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in it, never looking back to see what I&apos;d said because I was afraid cowardice would make me stop. I didn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y160 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stop, and when a voice in my head clamored that it would be madness to mail such a letter, that I would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y143 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be giving her my naked heart to hold in her hand, I ignored it with a child&apos;s breathless disregard of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">consequences. I often wondered if Janice kept that letter, but never quite got up enough courage to ask.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y161 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">All I know for sure is that I did not find it when I went through her things after the funeral, and of course</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y156 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that by itself means nothing. I suppose I never asked because I was afraid of discovering that burning</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y157 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">epistle meant less to her than it did to me.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Sometimes I sat and talked to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y26f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him, as I did with all of them - talking was our biggest, most important job, as I believe I have said - and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y270 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I tried to comfort him. I don&apos;t feel that I ever did, and part of my heart was glad he was suffering, you</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y271 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know. Felt he <span class="ff4">deserved</span> to suffer. I even thought sometimes of calling the governor (or getting Percy to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y272 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do it - hell, he was Percy&apos;s damn uncle, not mine) and asking for a stay of execution. <span class="ff4">We shouldn&apos;t burn</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y273 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him yet,<span class="ff3"> I&apos;d say </span>It&apos;s still hurting him too much, biting into him too much, twisting in his guts like a nice</div><div class="t m0 x4 h9 y274 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sharp stick.

Life for The Pres turned out to be twelve years. He was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y27e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drowned in the prison laundry in 1944. Not the Cold Mountain prison laundry; Cold Mountain closed in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y27f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1933. I don&apos;t suppose it mattered much to the inmates - wars is walls, as the cons say, and Old Sparky</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y280 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was every bit as lethal in his own little stone death chamber, I reckon, as he&apos;d ever been in the storage</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y281 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">room at Cold Mountain.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y282 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As for The Pres, someone shoved him face-first into a vat of dry-cleaning fluid and held him there.

Which actually meant</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just me and Brutal, because Percy kept pretty much to himself. I tell you, that young man was a genius at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finding things not to do. And every so often (but only when Percy wasn&apos;t around), the other guys would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show up to have what Harry liked to call &quot;a good gab.&quot; On many of these occasions the mouse would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also show up.

The door leading into the exercise yard slammed open, letting in a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flood of light, there was a confused rattle of chains, a frightened voice babbling away in a mixture of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">English and Cajun French (a patois the cons at Cold Mountain used to call da bayou), and Brutal</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hollering, &quot;Hey!

Quit it, Percy!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I had been half-dozing on what was to become Delacroix&apos;s bunk, but I was up in a hurry, my heart</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slugging away hard in my chest. Noise of that kind on E Block almost never happened until Percy came;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he brought it along with him like a bad smell.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on, you fuckin French-fried faggot!&quot; Percy yelled, ignoring Brutal completely. And here he came,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dragging a guy not much bigger than a bowling pin by one arm. In his other hand, Percy had his baton.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His teeth were bared in a strained grimace, and his face was bright red. Yet he did not look entirely</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unhappy. Delacroix was trying to keep up with him, but he had the legirons on, and no matter how fast</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he shuffled his feet, Percy pulled him along faster. I sprang out of the cell just in time to catch him as he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y287 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fell, and that was how Del and I were introduced.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy rounded on him, baton raised, and I held him back with one arm. Brutal came puffing up to us,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looking as shocked and nonplussed by all this as I felt.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t let him hit me no mo, m&apos;sieu,&quot; Delacroix babbled. &quot;S&apos;il vous plait, s&apos;il vous plait!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Let me at im, let me at im!&quot; Percy cried, lunging forward. He began to hit at Delacroix&apos;s shoulders with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his baton. Delacroix held his arms up, screaming, and the stick went whap-whap-whap against the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sleeves of his blue prison shirt. I saw him that night with the shirt off, and that boy had bruises from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y201 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christmas to Easter. Seeing them made me feel bad. He was a murderer, and nobody&apos;s darling, but that&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not the way we did things on E Block. Not until Percy came, anyhow.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y258 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Whoa! Whoa!&quot; I roared. &quot;Quit that!

Percy&apos;s club continued to flail away,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now on one side of me and now on the other. Sooner or later he was going to bring one down on me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">instead of on his intended target, and then there was going to be a brawl right here in this corridor, no</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">matter who his relations were.

And now Delacroix was bleeding from one ear and screaming. I gave up trying to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shield him, grabbed him by one shoulder, and hurled him into his cell, where he went sprawling on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bunk. Percy darted around me and gave him a final hard whap on the butt - one to go on, you could say.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Brutal grabbed him - Percy - I mean - by the shoulders and hauled him across the corridor.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I grabbed the cell door and ran it shut on its tracks. Then I turned to Percy, my shock and bewilderment</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at war with pure fury. Percy had been around about several months at that point, long enough for all of us</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to decide we didn&apos;t like him very much, but that was the first time I fully understood how out of control</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He stood watching me, not entirely without fear - he was a coward at heart, I never had any doubt of that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- but still confident that his connections would protect him. In that he was correct. I suspect there are</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people who wouldn&apos;t understand why that was, even after all I&apos;ve said, but they would be people who</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only know the phrase Great Depression from the history books. If you were there, it was a lot more than</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a phrase in a book, and if you had a steady job, brother, you&apos;d do almost anything to keep it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The color was fading out of Percy&apos;s face a little by then, but his cheeks were still flushed, and his hair,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which was usually swept back and gleaming with brilliantine, had tumbled over his forehead.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What in the Christ was that all about?&quot; I asked. &quot;I have never - I have never! - had a prisoner beaten</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">onto my block before!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Little fag bastard tried to cop my joint when I pulled him out of the van,&quot; Percy said. &quot;He had it coming,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and I&apos;d do it again.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yef ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked at him, too flabbergasted for words. I couldn&apos;t imagine the most predatory homosexual on God&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y108 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">green earth doing what Percy had just described. Preparing to move into a crossbar apartment on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Green Mile did not, as a rule, put even the most deviant of prisoners in a sexy mood.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked back at Delacroix, cowering on his bunk with his arms still up to protect his face. There were</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y229 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cuffs on his wrists and a chain running between his ankles. Then I turned to Percy &quot;Get out of here,&quot; I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yda ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said. &quot;I&apos;ll want to talk to you later.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Is this going to be in your report?&quot; he demanded truculently. &quot;Because if it is, I can make a report of my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own, you know.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y163 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I didn&apos;t want to make a report; I only wanted him out of my sight.

You could see that in his eyes as clear as day, and it made him even more dangerous.

That little homily was not what you&apos;d call</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one of my great successes. He cried all the way through it, sitting huddled up at the foot of his bunk, as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">far from me as he could get without actually fading into the corner. He cringed every time I moved, and I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">don&apos;t think he heard one word in six. Probably just as well.

I didn&apos;t know. There were a lot of things I didn&apos;t know then. I suppose I was naive.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 yc2 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y216 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After that, things went back to normal again ... for awhile, at least. Down in the county seat, the state was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preparing to bring John Coffey to trial, and Trapingus County Sheriff Homer Cribus was pooh-poohing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the idea that a lynch-mob might hurry justice along a little bit. None of that mattered to us; on E Block,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no one paid much attention to the news. Life on the Green Mile was, in a way, like life in a soundproof</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">room. From time to time you heard mutterings that were probably explosions in the outside world, but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that was about all. They wouldn&apos;t hurry with John Coffey; they&apos;d want to make damned sure of him.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On a couple of occasions Percy got to ragging Delacroix, and the second time I pulled him aside and told</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to come up to my office. It wasn&apos;t my first interview with Percy on the subject of his behavior, and it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wouldn&apos;t be the last, but it was prompted by what, was probably the clearest understanding of what he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was. He had the heart of a cruel boy who goes to the zoo not so he can study the animals but so he can</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">throw stones at them in their cages.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You stay away from him, now, you hear?&quot; I said. &quot;Unless I give you a specific order, just stay the hell</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">away from him.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy combed his hair back, then patted at it with his sweet little hands. That boy just loved touching his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hair. &quot;I wasn&apos;t doing nothing to him,&quot; he said. &quot;Only asking how it felt to know you had burned up some</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">babies, is all.&quot; Percy gave me a round-eyed, innocent stare.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You quit with it, or there&apos;ll be a report,&quot; I said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He laughed. &quot;Make any report you want,&quot; he said. &quot;Then I&apos;ll turn around and make my own. Just like I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yef ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told you when he came in. We&apos;ll see who comes off the best.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I leaned forward, hands folded on my desk, and spoke in a tone I hoped would sound like a friend being</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confidential. &quot;Brutus Howell doesn&apos;t like you much,&quot; I said. &quot;And when Brutal doesn&apos;t like someone, he&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been known to make his own report. He isn&apos;t much shakes with a pen, and he can&apos;t quit from licking that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y229 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pencil, so he&apos;s apt to report with his fists. If you know what I mean.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy&apos;s complacent little smile faltered. &quot;What are you trying to say&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;m not trying to say anything. I <span class="ff4">have</span> said it. And if you tell any of your ...friends ... about this</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discussion, I&apos;ll say you made the whole thing up.&quot; I looked at him all wide-eyed and earnest. &quot;Besides,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y163 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I&apos;m trying to be your friend, Percy. A word to the wise is sufficient, they say. And why would you want</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to get into it with Delacroix in the first place? He&apos;s not worth it.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And for awhile that worked. There was peace. A couple of times I was even able to send Percy with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean or Harry when Delacroix&apos;s time to shower had rolled around. We had the radio at night, Delacroix</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to relax a little into the scant routine of E Block, and there was peace.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then, one night, I heard him laughing.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y110 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry Terwilliger was on the desk, and soon he was laughing, too. I got up and went on down to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y111 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix&apos;s cell to see what he possibly had to laugh about.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He was in Delacroix&apos;s cell. More: he was sitting on Delacroix&apos;s shoulder and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y288 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looking calmly out through the bars at us with his little oildrop eyes. His tail was curled around his paws,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y289 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and he looked completely at peace. As for Delacroix - friend, you wouldn&apos;t have known it was the same</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man who&apos;d sat cringing and shuddering at the foot of his bunk not a week before. He looked like my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">daughter used to on Christmas morning, when she came down the stairs and saw the presents.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Watch dis!&quot; Delacroix said. The mouse was sitting on his right shoulder. Delacroix stretched out his left</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arm. The mouse scampered up to the top of Delacroix&apos;s head, using the man&apos;s hair (which was thick</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enough in back, at least) to climb up. Then he scampered down the other side, Delacroix giggling as his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tail tickled the side of his neck. The mouse ran all the way down his arm to his wrist, then turned,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scampered back up to Delacroix&apos;s left shoulder, and curled his tail around his feet again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;ll be damned,&quot; Harry said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y290 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I train him to do that,&quot; Delacroix said proudly. I thought, In a pig&apos;s ass you did, but kept my mouth shut.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y291 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;His name is Mr. Jingles.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y292 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Nah,&quot; Harry said goodnaturedly. &quot;It&apos;s Steamboat Willy, like in the pitcher-show. Boss Howell named</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y293 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y294 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It&apos;s Mr. Jingles,&quot; Delacroix said. On any other subject he would have told you that shit was Shinola, if</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y295 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you wanted him to, but on the subject of the mouse&apos;s name he was perfectly adamant. &quot;He whisper it in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yad ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my ear. Cap&apos;n, can I have a box for him? Can I have a box for my mous&apos;, so he can sleep in here wit me?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yae ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His voice began to fall into wheedling tones I had heard a thousand times before. &quot;I put him under my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y296 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bunk and he never be a scrid of trouble, not one.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Your English gets a hell of a lot better when you want something,&quot; I said, stalling for time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y133 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oh-oh,&quot; Harry murmured, nudging me. &quot;Here comes trouble.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y297 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Percy didn&apos;t look like trouble to me, not that night. He wasn&apos;t running his hands through his hair or</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y298 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fiddling with that baton of his, and the top button of his uniform shirt was actually undone. It was the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y299 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first time I&apos;d seen him that way, and it was amazing, what a change a little thing like that could make.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y29a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mostly, though, what struck me was the expression on his face. There was a calmness there. Not serenity</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y29b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- I don&apos;t think Percy Wetmore had a serene bone in his body - but the look of a man who has discovered</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y29c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he can wait for the things he wants. It was quite a change from the young man I&apos;d had to threaten with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutus Howell&apos;s fists only a few days before.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y29d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix didn&apos;t see the change, though; he cringed against the wall of his cell, drawing his knees up to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y29e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his chest. His eyes seemed to grow until they were taking up half his face. The mouse scampered up on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y29f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his bald pate and sat there. I don&apos;t know if he remembered that he also had reason to distrust Percy, but it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">certainly looked as if he did. Probably it was just smelling the little Frenchman&apos;s fear, and reacting off</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Well, well,&quot; Percy said. &quot;Looks like you found yourself a friend, Eddie.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix tried to reply-some hollow defiance about what would happen to Percy if Percy hurt his new</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pal would have been my guess - but nothing came out.

That he can keep it for a pet.&quot; I loaded my voice</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with skepticism, and sensed more than saw Harry looking at me in surprise. &quot;What do you think about</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I think it&apos;ll probably shit up his nose some night while he&apos;s sleeping and then run away,&quot; Percy said</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evenly, &quot;but I guess that&apos;s the French boy&apos;s lookout. I seen a pretty nice cigar box on Toot-Toot&apos;s cart the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other night. I don&apos;t know if he&apos;d give it away, though.

He knew Delacroix was fresh out of soft-hearted</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y87 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">judges. All he had left to hope for was the governor, who as a rule didn&apos;t issue clemency to folks who had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baked half a dozen of his constituents.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y153 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Even if he don&apos;t get a stay, that mouse&apos;d be shitting in that box until October, maybe even</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y154 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thanksgiving,&quot; Toot argued, but Brutal could see he was weakening. &quot;Who gonna buy a cigar box some</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y155 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse been using for a toilet?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y156 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oh jeez-Louise,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;That&apos;s the numbest thing I&apos;ve ever heard you say, Toot.

Nothing to it!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Old Toot knew better than to carry his protest any further; he&apos;d been on the yard long enough to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understand when he could afford to face into the breeze and when he&apos;d do better to bend in the hurricane.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This wasn&apos;t exactly a hurricane, but we bluesuits liked the mouse, and we liked the idea of Delacroix</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">having the mouse, and that meant it was at least a gale. So Delacroix got his box, and Percy was as good</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as his word - two days later the bottom was lined with soft pads of cotton batting from the dispensary.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy handed them over himself, and I could see the fear in Delacroix&apos;s eyes as he reached out through</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the bars to take them. He was afraid Percy would grab his hand and break his fingers. I was a little afraid</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of it too, but no such thing happened. That was the closest I ever came to liking Percy, but even then it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was hard to mistake the look of cool amusement in his eyes. Delacroix had a pet; Percy had one too.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix would keep his, petting it and loving it as long as he could; Percy would wait patiently (as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patiently as a man like him could anyway), and then burn his alive.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Mousie Hilton, open for business.&quot; Harry said. &quot;The only question is, will the little bugger use it?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That question was answered as soon as Delacroix caught Mr. Jingles up in one hand and lowered him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gently into the box. The mouse snuggled into the white cotton as if it were Aunt Bea&apos;s comforter, and that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was his home from then until ... well, I&apos;ll get to the end of Mr. Jingles&apos;s story in good time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Old Toot-Toots worries that the cigar box would, fill up with mouse-shit proved to be entirely</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">groundless. I never saw a single turd in there, and Delacroix said he never did, either, anywhere in his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cell, for that matter. Much later, around the time Brutal showed me the hole in the beam and we found</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the colored splinters, I moved a chair out of the restraint room&apos;s east corner and found a little pile of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse turds back there. He had always gone back to the same place to do his business, seemingly, and as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">far from us as he could get. Here&apos;s another thing: I never saw him peeing, and usually mice can hardly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y287 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turn the faucet off for two minutes at a time, especially while they&apos;re eating. I told you, the damned thing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y66 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was one of God&apos;s mysteries.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A week or so after Mr. Jingles had settled into the cigar box, Delacroix called me and Brutal down to his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cell to see something. He did that so much it was annoying - if Mr. Jingles so much as rolled over on his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back with his paws in the air, it was the cutest thing on God&apos;s earth, as far as that half-pint Cajun was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">concerned - but this time what he was up to really was sort of amusing.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix had been pretty much forgotten by the world following his conviction, but he had one relation</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- an old maiden aunt, I believe - who wrote him once a week. She had also sent him an enormous bag of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peppermint candies, the sort which are marketed under the name Canada Mints these days. They looked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like big pink pills. Delacroix was not allowed to have the whole bag at once, naturally - it was a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">five-pounder, and he would have gobbled them until he had to go to the infirmary with stomach-gripes.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Like almost every murderer we ever had on the Mile, he had absolutely no understanding of moderation.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y144 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We&apos;d give them out to him half a dozen at a time, and only then if he remembered to ask.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mr. Jingles was sitting beside Delacroix on the bunk when we got down there, holding one of those pink</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">candies in his paws and munching contentedly away at it.

He reached for the half-eaten pink mint. I expected the mouse</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to nip him, but Mr. Jingles gave over that mint - what remained of it, anyway - as meek as could be. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked at Brutal, and Brutal gave his head a little shake as if to say no, he didn&apos;t understand it, either.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Mr. Jingles plopped down into his box and lay there on his side in an exhausted way that made all</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three of us laugh.

A week or so after the incident of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peppermint candies - around the time when we&apos;d pretty much decided Delacroix wasn&apos;t going to feed his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pet to death, in other words - the Frenchman called me down to his cell.

But since I probably could have shot-putted Delacroix twenty</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yards one-handed on a good day, I decided to break the rule and see what he wanted.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Watch this, Boss Edgecombe,&quot; he said. &quot;You gonna see what Mr. Jingles can do!&quot; He reached behind</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the cigar box and brought up a small wooden spool.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Where&apos;d you get that?&quot; I asked him, although I supposed I knew. There was really only one person he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could have gotten it from.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Old Toot-Toot,&quot; he said. &apos;Watch this.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y117 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was already watching, and could see Mr. Jingles in his box, standing up with his small front paws</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">propped on the edge, his black eyes fixed on the spool Delacroix was holding between the thumb and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first finger of his right hand. I felt a funny little chill go up my back. I had never seen a mere mouse</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attend to something with such sharpness - with such <span class="ff4">intelligence.</span> I don&apos;t really believe that Mr. Jingles</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a supernatural visitation, and if I have given you that idea, I&apos;m sorry, but I have never doubted that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y201 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was a genius of his kind.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix bent over and rolled the threadless spool across the floor of his cell. It went easily, like a pair</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y258 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of wheels connected by an axle. The mouse was out of his box in a flash and across the floor after it, like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a dog chasing after a stick.

Maybe it&apos;s better to go on just as I have been; in the end, I guess the dates don&apos;t matter much, if</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you can remember the things you saw and keep them in the right order.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I know that things got squeezed together a little. When Delacroix&apos;s DOE papers finally came to me from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Curtis Anderson&apos;s office, I was amazed to see that our Cajun pal&apos;s date with Old Sparky had been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">advanced from when we had expected, a thing that was almost unheard of, even in those days when you</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">didn&apos;t have to move half of heaven and all the earth to execute a man. It was a matter of two days, I think,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the twenty-seventh of October to the twenty-fifth. Don&apos;t hold me to it exactly, but I know that&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">close; I remember thinking that Toot was going to get his Corona box back even sooner than he had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton, meanwhile, got to us later than expected. For one thing, his trial ran longer than Anderson&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">usually reliable sources had thought it would (when it came to Wild Billy, <span class="ff4">nothing</span> was reliable, we</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would soon discover, including our time-tested and supposedly foolproof methods of prisoner control).</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then, after he had been found guilty - that much, at least, went according to the script - he was taken to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Indianola General Hospital for tests. He had had a number of supposed seizures during the trial, twice</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serious enough to send him crashing to the floor, where he lay shaking and flopping and drumming his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feet on the boards. Wharton&apos;s court-appointed lawyer claimed he suffered from &quot;epilepsy spells&quot; and had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">committed his crimes while of unsound mind; the prosecution claimed the fits were the sham acting of a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y70 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coward desperate to save his own life. After observing the so-called &quot;epilepsy spells&quot; at first hand, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y71 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jury decided the fits were an act. The judge concurred but ordered a series of pre-sentencing tests after</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y148 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the verdict came down. God knows why; perhaps he was only curious.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It&apos;s a blue-eyed wonder that Wharton didn&apos;t escape from the hospital (and the irony that Warden Moore&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife, Melinda, was in the same hospital at the same time did not escape any of us), but he didn&apos;t. They</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had him surrounded by guards, I suppose, and perhaps he still had hopes of being declared incompetent</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by reason of epilepsy, if there is such a thing.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wasn&apos;t. The doctors found nothing wrong with his brain - physiologically, at least - and Billy &quot;the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Kid&quot; Wharton was at last bound for Cold Mountain. That might have been around the sixteenth or the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eighteenth; it&apos;s my recollection that Wharton arrived about two weeks after John Coffey and a week or</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y46 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ten days before Delacroix walked the Green Mile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y97 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The day our new psychopath joined us was an eventful one for me. I woke up at four that morning with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y98 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my groin throbbing and my penis feeling hot and clogged and swollen. Even before I swung my feet out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y85 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of bed, I knew that my urinary infection wasn&apos;t getting better, as I had hoped.

I lowered my pajama pants just as the urine started to flow, and that flow was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y154 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accompanied by the most excruciating. pain of my entire life.

All that, though,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could have been going on in Australia, or even on another planet. All I was concerned with was the pain</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that had set me on fire; my lower belly was burning, and my penis - an organ which had gone mostly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forgotten by me except when providing me the most intense physical pleasure a man can experience -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now felt as if it were melting; I expected to look down and see blood gushing from its tip, but it appeared</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be a perfectly ordinary stream of urine.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I hung onto the woodpile with one hand and put the other across my mouth, concentrating on keeping my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouth shut. I did not want to frighten my wife awake with a scream. It seemed that I went on pissing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forever, but at last the stream dried up. By then the pain had sunk deep into my stomach and my testicles,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">biting like rusty teeth. For a long while - it might have been as long as a minute - I was physically</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">incapable of getting up. At last the pain began to abate, and I struggled to my feet. I looked at my urine,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already soaking into the ground, and wondered if any sane God could make a world where such a little</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bit of dampness could come at the cost of such horrendous pain.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I would call in sick, I thought, and go see Dr. Sadler after all. I didn&apos;t want the stink and the queasiness of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dr. Sadler&apos;s sulfa tablets, but anything would be better than kneeling beside the woodpile, trying not to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scream while my prick was reporting that it had apparently been doused with coal-oil and set afire.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then, as I was swallowing aspirin in our kitchen and listening to Jan snore lightly in the other room, I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remembered that today was the day William Wharton was scheduled on the block, and that Brutal</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wouldn&apos;t be there - the roster had him over on the other side of the prison, helping to move the rest of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">library and some leftover infirmary equipment to the new building. One thing I didn&apos;t feel right about in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spite of my pain was leaving Wharton to Dean and Harry. They were good men, but Curtis Anderson&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">report had suggested that William Wharton was exceptionally bad news. This man just doesn&apos;t care, he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had written, underlining for emphasis.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y64 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By then the pain had abated some, and I could think. The best idea, it seemed to me, was to leave for the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y152 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prison early. I could get there at six, which was the time Warden Moores usually came in. He could get</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutus Howell reassigned to E Block long enough for Wharton&apos;s reception, and I&apos;d make my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long-overdue trip to the doctor. Cold Mountain was actually on my way.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y95 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Twice on the twenty-mile ride to the Penitentiary that sudden need to urinate overcame me. Both times I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y96 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was able to pull over and take care of the problem without embarrassing myself (for one thing, traffic on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y97 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">country roads at such an hour was all but nonexistent). Neither of these two voidings was as painful as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y98 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the one that had taken me off my feet on the way to the privy, but both times I had to clutch the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y85 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">passenger-side doorhandle of my little Ford coupe to hold myself up, and I could feel sweat running</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y86 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down my hot face. I was sick, all right, good and sick.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y141 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I made it, though, drove in through the south gate, parked in my usual place, and went right up to see the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y142 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">warden. It was going on six o&apos;clock by then. Miss Hannah&apos;s office was empty - she wouldn&apos;t be in until</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y153 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the relatively civilized hour of seven - but the light was on in Moores&apos;s office; I could see it through the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y154 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pebbled glass. I gave a perfunctory knock and opened the door. Moores looked up, startled to see anyone</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y155 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at that unusual hour, and I would have given a great deal not to have been the one to see him in that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y99 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">condition, with his face naked and unguarded. His white hair, usually so neatly combed, was sticking up</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in tufts and tangles; his hands were in it, yanking and pulling, when I walked in. His eyes were raw, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">skin beneath them puffy and swollen.

Shut the door and come in.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I did as he asked, forgetting my own pain for the first time since I&apos;d awakened that morning.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y218 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It&apos;s a brain tumor,&quot; Moores said. &quot;They got X-ray pictures of it. They seemed real pleased with their</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1dc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pictures, actually. One of them said they may be the best ones anyone&apos;s ever gotten, at least so far; said</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they&apos;re going to publish them in some biggety medical journal up in New England. It&apos;s the size of a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lemon, they said, and way down deep inside, where they can&apos;t operate. They say she&apos;ll be dead by</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christmas. I haven&apos;t told her. I can&apos;t think how. I can&apos;t think how for the life of me.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then he began to cry, big, gasping sobs that filled me with both pity and a kind of terror - when a man</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y100 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who keeps himself as tightly guarded as Hal Moores finally does lose control, it&apos;s frightening to watch. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y101 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood there for a moment, then went to him and put my arm around his shoulders. He groped out for me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with both of his own arms, like a drowning man, and began to sob against my stomach, all restraint</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">washed away. Later, after he got himself under control, he apologized. He did it without quite meeting</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my eyes, as a man does when he feels he has embarrassed himself dreadfully, maybe so deeply that he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can never quite live it down. A man can end up hating the fellow who has seen him in such a state. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought Warden Moores was better than that, but it never crossed my mind to do the business I had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">originally come for, and when I left Moores&apos;s office, I walked over to E Block instead of back to my car.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The aspirin was working by then, and the pain in my midsection was down to a low throb.

The worst was pretty much over, I thought, with no</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slightest idea that the worst of that day&apos;s mischief hadn&apos;t even begun.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 y1bf ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">11.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We thought he was still doped from the tests,&quot; Dean said late that afternoon.

I could see it was hurting him to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">talk and thought of telling him to let it go, but sometimes it hurts more to be quiet.

Even Percy, sitting off by himself in his own sullen little party of one, nodded.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal glanced at me, and for a moment I met his eyes. We were thinking pretty much that same thing,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that this was the way it happened. You were cruising along, everything going according to Hoyle, you</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made one mistake, and bang, the sky fell down on you.

I thought I saw something else in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal&apos;s eyes, as well: Harry and Dean would learn from their mistake.

He handed his paperwork over to the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">county sheriff (not Homer Cribus but some other elected yokel like him, I imagine), who in turn handed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over Mr. William Wharton, hellraiser extraordinaire, as Delacroix might have put it.

Wharton was dressed in a cotton hospital johnny and cheap felt slippers when they</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first met him on the second floor of the General Hospital, a scrawny man with a narrow, pimply face and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a lot of long, tangly blond hair. His ass, also narrow and also covered with pimples, stuck out the back of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the johnny. That was the part of him Harry and the others saw first, because Wharton was standing at the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">window and looking out at the parking lot when they came in. He didn&apos;t turn but just stood there, holding</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the curtains back with one hand, silent as a doll while Harry bitched at the county sheriff about being too</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lazy to get Wharton into his prison blues and the county sheriff lectured - as every county official I&apos;ve</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ever met seems bound to do - about what was his job and what was not.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Harry got tired of that part (I doubt it took him long), he told Wharton to turn around. Wharton</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did. He looked, Dean told us in his raspy bark of a half-choked voice, like any one of a thousand</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">backcountry stampeders who had wound their way through Cold Mountain during our years there. Boil</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that look down and what you got was a dullard with a mean steak. Sometimes you also discovered a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yellow streak in them, once their backs were to the wall, but more often there was nothing there but fight</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y70 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and mean and then more fight and more mean. There are people who see nobility in folks like Billy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y71 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton, but I am not one of them. A rat will fight, too, if it is cornered. This man&apos;s face seemed to have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y148 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no more personality than his acne-studded backside, Dean told us. His jaw was slack, his eyes distant, his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y149 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shoulders slumped, his hands dangling. He looked shot up with morphine, all right, every bit as coo-coo</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as any dopefiend any of them had ever seen.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At this, Percy gave another of his sullen nods.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y152 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Put this on,&quot; Harry said, indicating the uniform on the foot of the bed - it had been taken out of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brown paper it was wrapped in, but otherwise not touched-it was still folded just as it had been in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prison laundry, with a pair of white cotton boxer shorts poking out of one shirtsleeve and a pair of white</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">socks poking out of the other.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y96 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton seemed willing enough to comply, but wasn&apos;t able to get very far without help. He managed the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y97 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">boxers, but when it came to the pants, he kept trying to put both legs into the same hole. Finally Dean</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y98 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">helped him, getting his feet to go where they belonged and then yanking the trousers up, doing the fly,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y85 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and snapping the waistband.. Wharton only stood there, not even trying to help once he saw that Dean</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y86 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was doing it for him. He stared vacantly across the room, hands lax, and it didn&apos;t occur to any of them</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y87 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he was shamming. Not in hopes of escape (at least I don&apos;t believe that was it) but only in hopes of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">making the maximum amount of trouble when the right time came.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y153 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The papers were signed. William Wharton, who had become county property when he was arrested, now</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y154 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became the state&apos;s property. He was taken down the back stairs and through the kitchen, surrounded by</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y155 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bluesuits. He walked with his head down and his long-fingered hands dangling. The first time his cap fell</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y99 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off, Dean put it back on him. The second time, he just tucked it into his own back pocket.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y157 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He had another chance to make trouble in the back of the stagecoach, when they were shackling him, and</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

If he thought (even now I&apos;m not sure if he did, or if he did, how much), he must have thought that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the space was too small and the numbers too great to cause a satisfactory hooraw. So on went the chains,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one set running between his ankles and another set too long, it turned out, between his wrists.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The drive to Cold Mountain took an hour. During that whole time, Wharton sat on the lefthand bench up</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by the cab, head lowered, cuffed hands dangling between his knees. Every now and then he hummed a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little, Harry said, and Percy roused himself enough from his funk to say that the lugoon dripped spittle</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from his lax lower lip, a drop at a time, until it had made a puddle between his feet. Like a dog dripping</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off the end of its tongue on a hot summer day.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They drove in through the south gate when they got to the pen, right past my car, I guess. The guard on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the south pass tan back the big door between the lot and the exercise yard, and the stagecoach drove</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through. It was a slack time in the yard, not many men out and most of them hoeing in the garden.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pumpkin time, it would have been. They drove straight across to E Block and stopped. The driver opened</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the door and told them he was going to take the stagecoach over to the motor-pool to have the oil</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">changed, it had been good working with them. The extra guards went with the vehicle, two of them</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sitting in the back eating apples, the doors now swinging open.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That left Dean, Harry and Percy with one shackled prisoner. It should have been enough, would have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y60 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been enough, if they hadn&apos;t been lulled by the stick thin country boy standing head-down there in the dirt</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with chains on his wrists and ankles. They marched him the twelve or so paces to the door that opened</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into E Block, falling into the same formation we used when escorting prisoners down the Green Mile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry was on his left, Dean was on his right, and Percy was behind, with his baton in his hand. No one</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told me that, but I know damned well he had it out; Percy loved that hickory stick. As for me, I was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sitting in what would be Wharton&apos;s home until it came time for him to check into the hot place-first cell</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the right as you headed down the corridor toward the restraint room. I had my clipboard in my hands</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and was thinking of nothing but making my little set speech and getting the hell out. The pain in my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">groin was building up again, and all I wanted was to go into my office and wait for it to pass.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y152 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean stepped forward to unlock the door. He selected the right key from the bunch on his belt and slid it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into the lock. Wharton came alive just as Dean turned the key and pulled the handle. He voiced a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">screaming, gibbering cry - a kind of Rebel yell - that froze Harry to temporary immobility and pretty</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much finished Percy Wetmore for the entire encounter. I heard that scream through the partly opened</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y46 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">door and didn&apos;t associate it with anything human at first; I thought a dog had gotten into the yard</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">somehow and had been hurt; that perhaps some mean tempered con had hit it with a hoe.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y98 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton lifted his arms, dropped the chain which hung between his wrists over Dean&apos;s head, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y85 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">commenced to choke him with it. Dean gave a strangled cry and lurched forward, into the cool electric</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y86 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">light of our little world. Wharton was happy to go with him, even gave him a shove, all the time yelling</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y87 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and gibbering, even laughing. He had his arms cocked at the elbows with his fists up by Dean&apos;s ears,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yanking the chain as tight as he could, whipsawing it back and forth.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y153 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry landed on Wharton&apos;s back, wrapping one hand in our new boy&apos;s greasy blond hair and slamming</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y154 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his other fist into the side of Wharton&apos;s face as hard as he could. He had both a baton of his own and a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y155 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sidearm pistol, but in his excitement drew neither. We&apos;d had trouble with prisoners before, you bet, but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y99 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never one who&apos;d taken any of us by surprise the way that Wharton did. The man&apos;s slyness was beyond</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our experience. I had never seen its like before, and have never seen it again.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

All that slack looseness was gone. Harry said later that it was like jumping onto a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coiled nest of steel springs that had somehow come to life. Wharton, now inside and near the duty desk,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whirled to his left and flung Harry off. Harry hit the desk and went sprawling.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Whoooee, boys!&quot;<span class="ff3"> Wharton laughed. </span>&quot;Ain&apos;t this a party, now?

But Percy only stood there, hickory</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baton in hand, eyes as wide as soup-plates. Here was the chance he&apos;d been looking for, you would have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said, his golden opportunity to put that tallywhacker of his to good use, and he was too scared and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confused to do it. This wasn&apos;t some terrified little Frenchman or a black giant who hardly seemed to be in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his own body; this was a whirling devil.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I came out of Wharton&apos;s cell, dropping my clipboard and pulling my .38. I had forgotten the infection that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was heating up my middle for the second time that day. I didn&apos;t doubt the story the others told of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton&apos;s blank face and dull eyes when they told it, but that wasn&apos;t the Wharton I saw. What I saw was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the face of an animal - not an intelligent animal, but one filled with cunning ... and meanness ... and joy.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yes. He was doing what he had been made to do. The place and the circumstances didn&apos;t matter. The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other thing I saw was Dean Stanton&apos;s red, swelling face. He was dying in front of my eyes. Wharton saw</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the gun and turned Dean toward it, so that I&apos;d almost certainly have to hit one to hit the other.

Elaine is eighty, tall and slim, still erect and clear-eyed, very intelligent and refined. She walks very</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slowly because there&apos;s something wrong with her hips, and I know that the arthritis in her hands gives her</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">terrible misery, but she has a beautiful long neck - a swan neck, almost - and long, pretty hair that falls to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her shoulders when she lets it down.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Best of all, she doesn&apos;t think I&apos;m peculiar, or stand-offy.

Still, having a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">special friend - just that - is not so bad, and in some ways, it&apos;s even better. A lot of the problems and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heartaches that go with being boyfriend and girlfriend have simply burned out of us. And although I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know that no one under the age of, say, fifty would believe this, sometimes the embers are better than the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">campfire.

Sometimes I walk; sometimes I read; mostly what I&apos;ve been doing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the last month or so is writing this memoir among the plants in the solarium. I think there&apos;s more</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oxygen in that room, and it helps the old memory.

That&apos;s the one (just in case you don&apos;t have the basic cable services yourself) where most of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">films are in black and white and none of the women take their clothes off. For an old fart like me, that&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sort of soothing. There have been a good many nights when I&apos;ve slipped right off to sleep on the ugly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">green sofa in front of the TV while Francis the Talking Mule once more pulls Donald O&apos;Connor&apos;s skillet</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of the fire, or John Wayne cleans up Dodge, or Jimmy Cagney calls someone a dirty rat and then</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pulls a gun. Some of them are movies I saw with my wife, Janice (not just my ladyfriend but my <span class="ff4">best</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friend), and they calm me. The clothes they wear, the way they walk and talk, even the music on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soundtrack - all those things calm me. They remind me, I suppose, of when I was a man still walking on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the skin of the world, instead of a moth-eaten relic mouldering away in an old folks&apos; home where many of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the residents wear diapers and rubber pants.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was nothing soothing about what I saw this morning, though.

I can still remember what Curtis Anderson - he was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the assistant warden back in those days - wrote about him. &apos;Crazy-wild and proud of it.

The real mistake was Wharton&apos;s wrist-chain - it was a little too</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ab ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long. When Dean unlocked the door to E Block, Wharton was behind him. There were guards on either</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y199 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">side of him, but Anderson was right - Wild Billy just didn&apos;t care about such things.

Delacroix, who had been absolutely</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">silent during the scuffle (he had been in prison lots of times, that one, and knew when it was prudent to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep his yap shut and when it was relatively safe to open it again), began bawling loudly down the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corridor as Harry and Brutal helped Dean out.

He hated Delacroix. I don&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know just why, but he did.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Go see if Warden Moores is still here,&quot; I told Percy. &quot;If he is, give him a complete verbal report on what</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happened.

I had to put a hand over my mouth to stifle a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scream as I began to flow, and grabbed blindly for the lip of the washstand with the other. It wasn&apos;t like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my house, where I could fall to my knees and piss a puddle beside the woodpile; if I went to my knees</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">here, the urine would go all over the floor.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I managed to keep my feet and not to scream, but it was a close thing on both counts.

The smell coming up from the toilet bowl was swampy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and unpleasant, and I could see white stuff - pus, I guess - floating on the surface of the water.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

I was afraid Bill Dodge or someone else might have come in and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seen three prisoners with no attendants, but the place was empty. Wharton still lay unconscious on his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bunk, Delacroix had fallen silent, and John Coffey had never made a single noise at all, I suddenly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized. Not a peep. Which was worrisome.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I went down the Mile and glanced into Coffey&apos;s cell, half-expecting to discover he&apos;d committed suicide in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one of the two common Death Row ways either hanging himself with his pants, or gnawing into his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrists. No such thing, it turned out. Coffey merely sat on the end of his bunk with his hands in his lap,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the largest man I&apos;d ever seen in my life, looking at me with his strange, wet eyes.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Cap&apos;n?&quot; he said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What&apos;s up, big boy?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I need to see you.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Ain&apos;t you looking right at me, John Coffey?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He said nothing to this, only went on studying me with his strange, leaky gaze.

Mr. Jingles, his pet mouse (Delacroix</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would tell you he&apos;d trained Mr. Jingles to do tricks, but us folks who worked on the Green Mile were</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pretty much unanimous in the opinion that Mr. Jingles had trained himself), was jumping restlessly back</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y198 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and forth from one of Del&apos;s outstretched hands to the other, like an acrobat doing leaps from platforms</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">high above the center ring. His eyes were huge, his ears laid back against his sleek brown skull. I hadn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">any doubt that the mouse was reacting to Delacroix&apos;s nerves. As I watched, he ran down Delacroix&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pants leg and across the cell to where the brightly colored spool lay against one wall. He pushed the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y229 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spool back to Delacroix&apos;s foot and then looked up at him eagerly, but the little Cajun took no notice of his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yda ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friend, at least for the time being.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What happen, boss?&quot; Delacroix asked. &quot;Who been hurt?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Everything&apos;s jake,&quot; I said. &quot;Our new boy came in like a lion, but now he&apos;s passed out like a lamb.

So we&apos;ll just have us a chat through the bars, if it&apos;s all the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same to you, and - &quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Please!&quot; He was holding the bars so tightly that his knuckles were pale and his fingernails were white.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His face was long with distress, those strange eyes sharp with some need I could not understand.

All the same, I was going to do it.

My voice</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounded to my own ears like something which had come echoing down a long valley.

There was no heat, no feeling of electricity, but for a moment the color seemed to jump out of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everything, as if the world had been somehow squeezed and made to sweat. I could see every pore on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">john Coffey&apos;s face, I could see every bloodshot snap in his haunted eyes, I could see a tiny healing scrape</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on his chin.

His voice still came from far away, but when John Coffey</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bent forward, breaking eye-contact with me, the little Cajun&apos;s voice suddenly came clear. It was as if</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">someone had pulled wads of cotton or a pair of shooters&apos; plugs out of my ears. &quot;What&apos;s he doing to you?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y107 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I didn&apos;t answer. Coffey was bent forward over his own lap with his face working and his throat bulging.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His eyes were bulging, too. He looked like a man with a chicken bone caught in his throat.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;John!&quot; I said. I clapped him on the back; it was all I could think of to do. &quot;John, what&apos;s wrong?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y198 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He hitched under my hand, then made an unpleasant gagging, retching sound. His mouth opened the way</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">horses sometimes open their mouths to allow the bit - reluctantly, with the lips peeling back from the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teeth in a kind of desperate sneer. Then his teeth parted, too, and he exhaled a cloud of tiny black insects</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that looked like gnats or noseeums. They swirled furiously between his knees, turned white, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y229 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disappeared.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Suddenly all the strength went out of my middsection. It was as if the muscles there had turned to water.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I slumped back against the stone side of Coffey&apos;s cell. I remember thinking the name of the Savior -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ, Christ, Christ, over and over, like that - and I remember thinking that the fever had driven me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y118 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">delirious. That was all.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then I became aware that Delacroix was bawling for help; he was telling the world that John Coffey was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y119 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">killing me, and telling it at the top of his lungs. Coffey was bending over me, all right, but only to make</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y190 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sure I was okay.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Shut up, Del,&quot; I said, and got on my feet. I waited for the pain to rip into my guts, but it didn&apos;t happen. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was better. Really. There was a moment of dizziness, but that passed even before I was able to reach out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y164 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and grab the bars of Coffey&apos;s cell door for balance. &quot;I&apos;m totally okey-doke.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You get on outta here,&quot; Delacroix said, sounding like a nervy old woman telling a kid to climb down out</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He had to tilt his head up a little, but not much.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What did you do, big boy?&quot; I asked in a low voice. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Helped,&quot; he said. &quot;I helped it, didn&apos;t I?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y218 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yeah, I guess, but how? How did you help it?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2ca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He shook his head - right, left, back to dead center. He didn&apos;t know how he&apos;d helped it (how he&apos;d cured it)</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y204 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and his placid face suggested that he didn&apos;t give a rat&apos;s ass - any more than I&apos;d give a rat&apos;s ass about the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y205 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mechanics of running when I was leading in the last fifty yards of a Fourth of July Two-Miler. I thought</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about asking him how he&apos;d known I was sick in the first place, except that would undoubtedly have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gotten the same headshake. There&apos;s a phrase I read somewhere and never forgot, something about &quot;an</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y100 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enigma wrapped in a mystery.&quot; That&apos;s what John Coffey was, and I suppose the only reason he could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y101 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sleep at night was because he didn&apos;t care. Percy called him the ijit, which was cruel but not too far off the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mark. Our big boy knew his name, and knew it wasn&apos;t spelled like the drink, and that was just about all</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he cared to know.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As if to emphasize this for me, he shook his head m that deliberate way one more time, then lay down on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his bunk with his hands clasped under his left cheek like a pillow and his face to the wall. His legs</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dangled off the end of the bunk from the shins on down, but that never seemed to bother him. The back</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his shirt had pulled up, and I could see the scars that crisscrossed his skin.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I left the cell, turned the locks, then faced Delacroix, who was standing across the way with his hands</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrapped around the bars of his cell, looking at me anxiously. Perhaps even fearfully. Mr. Jingles perched</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on his shoulder with his fine whiskers quivering like filaments. &quot;What dat darkie-man do to you?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix asked. &quot;Waddit gris-gris?

There was a nestle of sweat-beads on his upper lip.

Even the nail had grown back. I believed Roy Delfines when he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">testified at Thursday-night rejoicing. There was a naked, uncomplicated honesty in what he said as he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood there talking with his hands jammed deep into the pockets of his biballs that was impossible not to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe. &quot;It itch him some when thet finger started coming, kep him awake nights,&quot; Roy Delfines said,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;but he knowed it was the Lord&apos;s itch and let it be.&quot; Praise Jesus, The Lord Is Mighty.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roy Delfines&apos;s story was only one of many; I grew up in a tradition of miracles and healings.

So I resolved to keep my mouth completely</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shut on the subject, with never an idea of how soon I&apos;d be telling the story, or who I&apos;d be telling it to.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But I was curious about my big boy, and there&apos;s no sense not admitting it. After what had happened to me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there in his cell, I was more curious than ever.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 y5b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before leaving that night, I arranged with Brutal to cover for me the next day, should I come in a little</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">late, and when I got up the following morning, I set out for Tefton, down in Trapingus County.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;m not sure I like you worrying so much about this fellow Coffey,&quot; my wife said, handing me the lunch</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she&apos;d put up for me-Janice never believed in roadside hamburger stands; she used to say there was a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bellyache waiting in every one. &quot;It&apos;s not like you, Paul.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;m not worried about him,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m curious, that&apos;s all.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;In my experience, one leads to the other,&quot; Janice said tartly, then gave me a good, hearty kiss on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouth. &quot;You look better, at least, I&apos;ll say that. For awhile there, you had me nervous.

At the courthouse they told me that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hammersmith had been there but had left when a burst waterpipe had closed down the main proceedings,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which happened to be a rape trial (in the pages of the <span class="ff4">Intelligencer</span> the crime would be referred to as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y116 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;assault on a woman,&quot; which was how such things were done in the days before Ricki Lake and Carnie</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wilson came on the scene). They guessed he&apos;d probably gone on home. I got some directions out a dirt</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">road so rutted and narrow I just about didn&apos;t dare take my Ford up it, and there I found my man.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hammersmith had written most of the stories on the Coffey trial, and it was from him I found out most of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the details about the brief manhunt that had netted Coffey in the first place. The details the <span class="ff4">Intelligencer</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y200 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">considered too gruesome to print is what I mean, of course.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mrs. Hammersmith was a young woman with a tired, pretty face and hands red from lye soap. She didn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y201 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ask my business, just led me through a small house fragrant with the smell of baking and onto the back</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">porch, where her husband sat with a bottle of pop in his hand and an unopened copy of <span class="ff4">Liberty </span>magazine</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y203 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on his lap. There was a small, sloping backyard; at the foot of it, two little ones were squabbling and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laughing over a swing. From the porch, it was impossible to tell their sexes, but I thought they were boy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and girl. Maybe even twins, which cast an interesting sort of light on their father&apos;s part, peripheral as it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been, in the Coffey trial. Nearer at hand, set like an island in the middle of a turdstudded patch of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bare, beatup-looking ground, was a doghouse. No sign of Fido; it was another unseasonably hot day, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I guessed he was probably inside, snoozing.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He glanced at me, glanced at his wife, then looked back at his kids, which was where</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2cc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his heart obviously lay. He was a thin man - almost painfully thin, as if he had just begun to recover from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2cd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a serious illness - and his hair had started to recede. His wife touched his shoulder tentatively with one of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2ce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her red, wash-swollen hands. He didn&apos;t look at it or reach up to touch it, and after a moment she took it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back. It occurred to me, fleetingly, that they looked more like brother and sister than husband and wife -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he&apos;d gotten the brains, she&apos;d gotten the looks, but neither of them had escaped some underlying</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">resemblance, a heredity that could never be escaped. Later, going home, I realized they didn&apos;t look alike</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2cf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at all; what made them seem to was the aftermath of stress and the lingering of sorrow. It&apos;s strange how</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pain marks our faces, and makes us look like family.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She said, &quot;Yew-all want a cold drink, Mr. - ?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It&apos;s Edgecombe,&quot; I said. &quot;Paul Edgecombe. And thank you. A cold drink would be wonderful, ma&apos;am.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She went back inside. I held out my hand to Hammersmith, who gave it a brief shake. His grip was limp</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and cold. He never took his eyes off the kids down at the bottom of the yard.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Mr. Hammersmith, I&apos;m E Block superintendent at Cold Mountain State Prison. That&apos;s-&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y246 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I know what it is,&quot; he said, looking at me with a little more interest. &quot;So - the bull-goose screw of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Green Mile is standing on my back porch, just as big as life. What brings you fifty miles to talk to the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1eb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">local rag&apos;s only full-time reporter?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;John Coffey,&quot; I said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I think I expected some sort of strong reaction (the kids who could have been twins working at the back</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of my mind - and perhaps the doghouse, too; the Dettericks had had a dog), but Hammersmith only</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">raised his eyebrows and sipped at his drink. &quot;Coffey&apos;s your problem now, isn&apos;t he?&quot; Hammersmith asked.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He&apos;s not much of a problem,&quot; I said. &quot;He doesn&apos;t like the dark, and he cries a lot of the time, but neither</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2da ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing makes much of a problem in our line of work. We see worse.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2db ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Cries a lot, does he?&quot; Hammersmith asked. &quot;Well, he&apos;s got a lot to cry about, I&apos;d say. Considering what</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2dc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he did. What do you want to know?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2dd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Anything you can tell me. I&apos;ve read your newspaper stories, so I guess what I want is anything that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2de ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wasn&apos;t in them.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2df ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He gave me a sharp, dry look. &quot;Like how the little girls looked?

Poor little mites are</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dead. But Coffey&apos;s not - not yet - and I&apos;m curious about him.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;All right,&quot; he said. &quot;Pull up a chair and sit, Mr. Edgecombe. You&apos;ll forgive me if I sounded a little sharp</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just now, but I get to see plenty of vultures in my line of work. Hell, I&apos;ve been accused of being one of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">em often enough, myself.

<div id="pf50" class="pf w2 h2" data-page-no="50"><div class="pc pc50 w2 h2"><div class="c x1 y1 w3 h3"><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y29 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;And are you?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Sure enough, I guess,&quot; he said, sounding almost indifferent. The story he told me is pretty much the one</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y54 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I set down earlier in this account - how Mrs. Detterick found the porch empty, with the screen door</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pulled off its upper hinge, the blankets cast into one corner, and blood on the steps; how her son and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">husband had taken after the girls&apos; abductor; how the posse had caught up to them first and to John Coffey</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not much later. How Coffey had been sitting on the riverbank and wailing, with the bodies curled in his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">massive arms like big dolls. The reporter, rack-thin in his open-collared white shirt and gray town pants,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoke in a low, unemotional voice - but his eyes never left his own two children as they squabbled and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laughed and took turns with the swing down there in the shade at the foot of the slope. Sometime in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">middle of the story, Mrs. Hammersmith came back with a bottle of homemade root beer, cold and strong</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and delicious. She stood listening for awhile, then interrupted long enough to call down to the kids and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tell them to come up directly, she had cookies due out of the oven. &quot;We will, Mamma!&quot; called a little</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">girl&apos;s voice, and the woman went back inside again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Hammersmith had finished, he said: &quot;So why do you want to know? I never had me a visit from a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Big House screw before, it&apos;s a first.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I told you - &quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Curiosity, yep. Folks get curious, I know it, I even thank God for it, I&apos;d be out of a job and might</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actually have to go to work for a living without it. But fifty miles is a long way to come to satisfy simple</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">curiosity, especially when the last twenty is over bad roads. So why don&apos;t you tell me the truth,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Edgecombe? I satisfied yours, so now you satisfy mine.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Well,<span class="ff3"> I could say, I </span>had this urinary infection, and John Coffey put his hands on me and healed it. The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h9 y1be ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man who raped and murdered those two little girls did that. So I wondered about him, of course - anyone</div><div class="t m0 x4 h9 y25a ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would. I even wondered if maybe Homer Cribus and Deputy Rob McGee didn&apos;t maybe collar the wrong</div><div class="t m0 x4 h9 y22c ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man. In spite of all the evidence against him I wonder that. Because a man who has a power like that in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h9 y15b ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his hands, you don&apos;t usually think of him as the kind of man who rapes and murders children.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y287 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">No, maybe that wouldn&apos;t do.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;There are two things I&apos;ve wondered about,&quot; I said. &quot;The first is if he ever did anything like that before.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hammersmith turned to me, his eyes suddenly sharp and bright with interest, and I saw he was a smart</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellow. Maybe even a brilliant fellow, in a quiet way. &quot;Why?&quot; he asked. &quot;What do you know,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Edgecombe? What has he said?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Nothing. But a man who does this sort of thing once has usually done it before. They get a taste for it.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;They do. They certainly do.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y190 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;And it occurred to me that it would be easy enough to follow his backtrail and find out. A man his size,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y191 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and a Negro to boot, can&apos;t be that hard to trace.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You&apos;d think so, but you&apos;d be wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;In Coffey&apos;s case, anyhow. I know.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You tried?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y111 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I did, and came up all but empty.

No surprise there; he was just across</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the river from the Great Southern tracks when they collared him, and that&apos;s probably how he came down</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">here from Tennessee. I got a letter from a man who said he&apos;d hired a big bald black man to shift crates for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him in the early spring of this year - this as in Kentucky. I sent him a picture of Coffey and he said that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was the man.

The Okies want to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pick peaches in California, the poor whites from up in the brakes want to build cars in Detroit, the black</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">folks from Mississippi want to go up to New England and work in the shoe factories or the textile mills.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Everyone - black as well as white - thinks it&apos;s going to be better over the next jump of land.

Even a giant like Coffey doesn&apos;t get noticed everywhere he goes - until, that is, he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decides to kill a couple of little girls. Little <span class="ff4">white</span> girls.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Do you believe that?&quot; I asked.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He gave me a bland look from his too-thin face. &quot;Sometimes I do,&quot; he said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His wife leaned out of the kitchen window like an engineer from the cab of a locomotive and called,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y107 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Kids!

The prosecutor, George Peterson, objected like hell, but the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">judge allowed it.

His eyes shifted back to me. &quot;And if you think you&apos;re gonna put that nut-coat on me,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you got another think coming, old hoss.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You&apos;re not the one who says go or jump back around here,&quot; I told him. &quot;You should know that, but I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guess you&apos;re too dumb to pick it up without a little teaching.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I finished unlocking the door and ran it back on its track. Wharton retreated to the bunk, his cock still</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hanging out of his pants, put his hands out to me, palms up, then beckoned with his fingers. &quot;Come on,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you ugly motherfucker,&quot; he said. &quot;They be schoolin, all right, but this old boy&apos;s well set up to be the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teacher.&quot; He shifted his gaze and his darktoothed grin to Brutal. &quot;Come on, big fella, you first. This time</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you cain&apos;t sneak up behind me. Put down that gun - you ain&apos;t gonna shoot it anyway, not you - and we&apos;ll</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go man-to-man. See who&apos;s the better fel-&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal stepped into the cell, but not toward Wharton. He moved to the left once he was through the door,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y200 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Wharton&apos;s narrow eyes widened as he saw the firehose pointed at him.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No, you don&apos;t,&quot; he said. &quot;Oh no, you d-&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Dean!&quot; I yelled. &quot;Turn it on! All the way!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y191 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton jumped forward, and Brutal hit him a good smart lick - the kind of lick I&apos;m sure Percy dreamed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y192 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of - across his forehead, laying his baton right over Wharton&apos;s eyebrows. Wharton, who seemed to think</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y193 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we&apos;d never seen trouble until we&apos;d seen him, went to his knees, his eyes open but blind. Then the water</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y194 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came, Harry staggering back a step under its power and then holding steady, the nozzle firm in his hands,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pointed like a gun. The stream caught Wild Bill Wharton square in the middle of his chest, spun him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y195 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">halfway around, and drove him back under his bunk.

I only had one quick glance at him, but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that was enough to observe his same old expression, both sad and serene. It was as if he&apos;d seen the whole</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing before, not just once or twice but a thousand times.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Kill the water!&quot; Brutal shouted back over his shoulder, then raced forward into the cell. He sank his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands into the semi-conscious Wharton&apos;s armpits and dragged him out from under his bunk. Wharton was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coughing and making a glub-glub sound. Blood was dribbling into his dazed eyes from above his brows,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where Brutal&apos;s stick had popped the skin open in a line.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We had the straitjacket business down to a science, did Brutus Howell and me; we&apos;d practiced it like a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">couple of vaudeville hoofers working up a new dance routine. Every now and then, that practice paid off.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Now, for instance. Brutal sat Wharton up and held out his arms toward me the way a kid might hold out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the arms of a Raggedy Andy doll. Awareness was just starting to seep back into Wharton&apos;s eyes, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knowledge that if he didn&apos;t start fighting right away, it was going to be too late, but the lines were still</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down between his brain and his muscles, and before he could repair them, I had rammed the sleeves of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the coat up his arms and Brutal was doing the buckles up the back. While he took care of that, I grabbed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the cuff-straps, pulled Wharton&apos;s arms around his sides, and linked his wrists together with another</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">canvas strap. He ended up looking like he was hugging himself.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Goddam you, big dummy, how dey doin widdim?&quot; Delacroix screamed. I heard Mr. Jingles squeaking,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as if he wanted to know, too.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y91 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy arrived, his shirt wet and sticking to him from his struggles with the watermain, his face glowing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y92 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with excitement. Dean came along behind him, wearing a bracelet of purplish bruise around his throat</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y62 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and looking a lot less thrilled.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on, now, Wild Bill,&quot; I said, and yanked Wharton to his feet. &quot;Little walky-walky.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c0 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t you call me that!&quot;<span class="ff3"> Wharton screamed shrilly, and I think that for the first time we were seeing real</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y287 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feelings, and not just a clever animal&apos;s camouflage spots. &quot;Wild Bill Hickok wasn&apos;t no range-rider!

Kind of a cooling-off room.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton gave a furious, inarticulate scream and threw himself at Brutal, even though he was snugly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buckled into the coat now, and his arms were wrapped around behind him. Percy made to draw his baton</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- the Wetmore Solution for all of life&apos;s problems - and Dean put a hand on his wrist. Percy gave him a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">puzzled, half-indignant look, as if to say that after what Wharton had done to Dean, Dean should be the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y144 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">last person in the world to want to hold him back.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal pushed Wharton backward.

We</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">banged him into the last cell on the right while Dean, Harry, and Percy (who for once wasn&apos;t complaining</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about being unfairly overworked) yanked all of the crap out of the restraint room. While they did that, I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had a brief conversation with Wharton.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You think you&apos;re tough,&quot; I said, &quot;and maybe you are, sonny, but in here tough don&apos;t matter. Your</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stampeding days are over. If you take it easy on us, we&apos;ll take it easy on you.

He was struggling</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">against the straitjacket even though he must have known it would do no good, and his face was as red as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a tomato. &quot;And until I&apos;m gone, I&apos;ll make your lives miserable.&quot; He bared his teeth at me like an angry</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baboon.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;If that&apos;s all you want, to make our lives miserable, you can quit now, because you&apos;ve already</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">succeeded,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;But as far as your time on the Mile goes, Wharton, we don&apos;t care if you spend</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all of it in the room with the soft walls. And you can wear that damned nut-coat until your arms gangrene</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from lack of circulation and fall right off.&quot; He paused. &quot;No one much comes down here, you know.

Honest Injun.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry appeared in the cell doorway. The end of the corridor looked like a rummage sale, but we&apos;d set</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">things to rights with good speed once we got started. We had before; we knew the drill. &quot;All ready,&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal grabbed the bulge in the canvas where Wharton&apos;s right elbow was and yanked him to his feet.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on, Wild Billy.

Take my word for it.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That&apos;s the way it was, too. The man we took back to his cell the next night at nine was quiet, pallid, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemingly chastened. He walked with his head down, made no effort to attack anyone when the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">straitjacket came off, and only stared listlessly at me when I told him it would go just the same the next</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time, and he just had to ask himself how much time he wanted to spend pissing in his pants and eating</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baby-food a spoonful at a time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;ll be good, boss, I learnt my lesson,&quot; he whispered in a humble little voice as we put him back in his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cell.

Toot himself undoubtedly knew better, but to him the snack-wagon was always</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a case of a nickel is a nickel, a dime is a dime, I&apos;d sing another chorus but I don&apos;t have the time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That night, when Brutal ran his check-round, Wharton was standing at the door of his cell.

He had crammed the entire</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moon-pie into his trap, held it there until it liquefied, and then used it like chewing tobacco.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y116 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton fell back on his bunk wearing a chocolate goatee, kicking his legs and screaming with laughter</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and pointing to Brutal, who was wearing a lot more than a goatee. &quot;Li&apos;l Black Sambo, yassuh, boss,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yassuh, howdoo you do?&quot; Wharton held his belly and howled. &quot;Gosh, if it had only been ka-ka!

And the situation might continue for quite awhile, because somewhere he had a lawyer who was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beating the bushes, telling folks how wrong it would be to kill this fellow upon whose brow the dew of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">youth had not yet dried - and who was, incidentally, as white as old Jeff Davis. There was no sense</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">complaining about it, because keeping Wharton out of the chair was his lawyer&apos;s job. Keeping him safely</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jugged was ours.

The doctors were</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">done with her; they had their interesting, newfangled X-ray photographs of the tumor in her head; they</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had documented the weakness in her hand and the paralyzing pains that racked her almost constantly by</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then, and were done with her. They gave her husband a bunch of pills with morphine in them and sent</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Melinda home to die. Hal Moores had some sick-leave piled up - not a lot, they didn&apos;t give you a lot in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those days, but he took what he had so he could help her do what she had to do.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My wife and I went to see her three days or so after she came home. I called ahead and Hal said yes, that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be fine, Melinda was having a pretty good day and would enjoy seeing us.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I hate calls like this,&quot; I said to Janice as we drove to the little house where the Mooreses had spent most</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of their marriage.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;So does everyone, honey,&quot; she said, and patted my hand. &quot;We&apos;ll bear up under it, and so will she.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I hope so.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We found Melinda in the sitting room, planted in a bright slant of unseasonably warm October sun, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my first shocked thought was that she had lost ninety pounds. She hadn&apos;t, of course - if she&apos;d lost that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much weight, she hardly would have been there at all - but that was my brain&apos;s initial reaction to what my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyes were reporting. Her face had fallen away to show the shape of the underlying skull, and her skin</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was as white as parchment. There were dark circles under her eyes. And it was the first time I ever saw</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her in her rocker when she didn&apos;t have a lapful of sewing or afghan squares or rags for braiding into a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rug. She was just sitting there. Like a person in a train-station.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Melinda,&quot; my wife said warmly. I think she was as shocked as I was - more, perhaps - but she hid it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">splendidly, as some women seem able to do. She went to Melinda, dropped on one knee beside the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rocking chair in which the warden&apos;s wife sat, and took one of her hands. As she did, my eye happened on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the blue hearthrug by the fireplace. It occurred to me that it should have been the shade of tired old limes,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y200 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because now this room was just another version of the Green Mile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I brought you some tea,&quot; Jan said, &quot;the kind I put up myself.

I helped it, didn&apos;t</span> I? Like a rhyme you can&apos;t get rid of.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hal came in then. He collared me, and you can believe me when I say I was glad to be collared. We went</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into the kitchen, and he poured me half a shot of white whiskey, hot stuff fresh out of some countryman&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still. We clinked our glasses together and drank. The shine went down like coal-oil, but the bloom in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">belly was heaven. Still, when Moores tipped the mason jar at me, wordlessly asking if I wanted the other</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">half, I shook my head and waved it off. Wild Bill Wharton was out of restraints - for the time being,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anyway - and it wouldn&apos;t be safe to go near where he was with a booze-clouded head. Not even with bars</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between us.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I don&apos;t know how long I can take this, Paul,&quot; he said in a low voice. &quot;There&apos;s a girl who comes in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mornings to help me with her, but the doctors I say she may lose control of her bowels, and ... and ...&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He stopped, his throat working, trying hard not to cry in front of me again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Go with it as best you can,&quot; I said. I reached out across the table and briefly squeezed his palsied,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">liverspotted hand. &quot;Do that day by day and give the rest over to God. There&apos;s nothing else you can do, is</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I guess not. But it&apos;s hard, Paul. I pray you never have to find out how hard.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He made an effort to collect himself.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Now tell me the news.

She wanted to know if it was really gone. Really gone, I told her.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That&apos;s fine, then,&quot; she said, and kissed me over the eyebrow, in that shivery place of mine. &quot;Maybe we</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1af ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ought to, you know, get up to a little something. If you have the time and the inclination, that is.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfa ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Having plenty of the latter and just enough of the former, I took her by the hand and led her into the back</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bedroom and took her clothes off as she stroked the part of me that swelled and throbbed but didn&apos;t hurt</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anymore. And as I moved in her sweetness, slipping through it in that slow way she liked - that we both</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y110 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">liked - I thought of John Coffey, saying he&apos;d helped it, he&apos;d helped it, hadn&apos;t he? Like a snatch of song</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y111 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that won&apos;t leave your mind until it&apos;s damned good and ready.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

That thought led to how Percy was going to be out front this time, and I felt a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shiver of dread. I told myself to just go with it, one execution and we&apos;d very likely be shut of Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wetmore for good ... but still I felt that shiver, as if the infection I&apos;d been suffering with wasn&apos;t gone at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all, but had only switched locations, from boiling my groin to freezing my backbone.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 ya0 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on,&quot; Brutal told Delacroix the following evening. &quot;We&apos;re going for a little walk.

They watched as Brutal unlocked the door to the exercise yard, where another two</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y118 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guards were waiting to join him, and led Delacroix out, bound for his command performance before the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yde ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grand high poohbahs of Cold Mountain Penitentiary. We waited until the door was locked again, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then I looked toward my office.

<div id="pf5d" class="pf w2 h2" data-page-no="5d"><div class="pc pc5d w2 h2"><div class="c x1 y1 w3 h3"><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This is the real circus, I thought, closing my eyes for a second. This is the real circus right here, and we&apos;re</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all just a bunch of trained mice. Then I put the thought out of my mind, and we started to rehearse.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 y31c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The first rehearsal went well, and so did the second. Percy performed better than I could have hoped for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in my wildest dreams. That didn&apos;t mean things would go right when the time really came for the Cajun to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">walk the Mile, but it was a big step in the right direction. It occurred to me that it had gone well because</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y320 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy was at long last doing something he cared about. I felt a surge of contempt at that, and pushed it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y321 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">away. What did it matter? He would cap Delacroix and roll him, and then both of them would be gone. If</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y322 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that wasn&apos;t a happy ending, what was? And, as Moores had pointed out, Delacroix&apos;s nuts were going to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y323 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fry no matter who was out front.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y324 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Still, Percy had shown to good advantage in his new role and he knew it. We all did. As for me, I was too</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y325 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relieved to dislike him much, at east or the time being. It looked as if things were going to go all right. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y326 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was further relieved to find that Percy actually listened when we suggested some things he could do that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y327 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">might improve his performance even more, or at least cut down the possibility of something going</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y328 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrong. If you want to know the truth, we got pretty enthusiastic about it - even Dean, who ordinarily</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y329 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood well back from Percy - physically as well as mentally, if he could. None of it that surprising, either,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I suppose - for most men, nothing is more flattering than having a young person actually pay attention to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his advice, and we were no different in that regard. As a result, not a one of us noticed that Wild Bill</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton was no longer looking up at the ceiling. That includes me, but I know he wasn&apos;t. He was looking</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at us as we stood there by the duty desk, gassing and giving Percy advice. Giving him advice! And him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pretending to listen! Quite a laugh, considering how things turned out!</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The sound of a key rattling into the lock of the door to the exercise yard put an end to our little</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y330 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">postrehearsal critique. Dean gave Percy a warning glance. &quot;Not a word or a wrong look,&quot; he said. &quot;We</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y331 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">don&apos;t want him to know what we&apos;ve been doing. It&apos;s not good for them. Upsets them.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y332 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy nodded and ran a finger across his lips in a mum&apos;s-the-word gesture that was supposed to be funny</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y333 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and wasn&apos;t. The exercise-yard door opened and Delacroix came in, escorted by Brutal, who was carrying</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y334 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the cigar box with the colored spool in it, the way the magician&apos;s assistant in a vaudeville show might</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y335 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carry the boss&apos;s props offstage at the end of the act. Mr. Jingles was perched on Delacroix&apos;s shoulder.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y336 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And Delacroix himself? I -tell you what - Lillie Langtry couldn&apos;t have looked any glowier after</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y337 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">performing at the White House. &quot;They love Mr. Jingles!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y338 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix proclaimed. &quot;They laugh and cheer and clap they hands!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y339 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Well, that&apos;s aces,&quot; Percy said. He spoke in an indulgent, proprietary way that didn&apos;t sound like the old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy at all. &quot;Pop on back in your cell, old-timer.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix gave him a comical look of distrust, and the old Percy came busting out. He bared his teeth in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a mock snarl and made as if to grab Delacroix. It was a joke, of course, Percy was happy, not in a serious</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grabbing mood at all, but Delacroix didn&apos;t know that. He jerked away with an expression of fear and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dismay, and tripped over one of Brutal&apos;s big feet. He went down hard, hitting the linoleum with the back</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his head. Mr. Jingles leaped away in time to avoid being crushed, and went squeaking off down the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y340 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Green Mile to Delacroix&apos;s cell.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y341 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix got to his feet, gave the chuckling Percy a single hate-filled glance, then scurried off after his</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

If true, it only proves a cynical old adage I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard once, something about how no good deed goes unpunished. Remember me telling you about how,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after he&apos;d chased the mouse down to the restraint room on one of those two occasions before Delacroix</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">joined us, Perry got a little too close to The Pres&apos;s cell? Doing that was dangerous, which was why the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Green Mile was so wide - when you walked straight down the middle of it, you couldn&apos;t be reached from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the cells. The Pres hadn&apos;t done anything to Percy, but I remember thinking that Arlen Bitterbuck might</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have, had it been him Percy had gotten too close to. just to teach him a lesson.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Well, The Pres and The Chief had both moved on, but Wild Bill Wharton had taken their place. He was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worse-mannered than The Pres or The Chief had ever dreamed of being, and he&apos;d been watching the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole little play, hoping for a chance to get on stage himself. That chance now fell into his lap, courtesy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Percy Wetmore.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Hey, Del!&quot; Percy called, half-laughing, starting after Brutal and Delacroix and drifting much too close</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y60 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to Wharton&apos;s side of the Green Mile without realizing it. &quot;Hey, you numb shit, I didn&apos;t mean nothin by it!</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Are you all ri-&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton was up off his bunk and over to the bars of his cell in a flash - never in my time as a guard did I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see anyone move so fast, and that includes some of the athletic young men Brutal and I worked with later</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y91 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at Boys&apos; Correctional. He shot his arms out through the bars and grabbed Percy, first by the shoulders of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y92 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his uniform blouse and then by the throat. Wharton dragged him back against his cell door. Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y62 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">squealed like a pig in a slaughter-chute, and I saw from his eyes that he thought he was going to die.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Ain&apos;t you sweet,&quot; Wharton whispered. One hand left Percy&apos;s throat and ruffled through his hair. &quot;Soft!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he said, half-laughing. &quot;Like a girl&apos;s.

All the color had drained</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from his face, and the blemishes on his cheeks stood out like birthmarks. His eyes were huge and wet. A</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">line of spittle leaked from one comer of his twitching mouth.

He had finally gotten his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y144 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lesson in keeping to the center of the Green Mile and away from the frumious bandersnatch, the teeth</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y145 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that bite and the claws that catch.

He looked like someone who has just escaped being</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">raped.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was a moment of utter stop then, a quiet so thick that the only sound was the sobbing whistle of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy&apos;s breathing. What broke it was cackling laughter, so sudden and so completely its own mad thing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that it was shocking. Wharton, was my first thought, but it wasn&apos;t him. It was Delacroix, standing in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">open door of his cell and pointing at Percy. The mouse was back on his shoulder, and Delacroix looked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like a small but malevolent male witch, complete with imp.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Lookit him, he done piss his pants!&quot; Delacroix howled. &quot;Lookit what the big man done!

Percy stared</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at him, seemingly incapable of moving or speaking. Wharton stepped back to the bars of his cell, looked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down at the dark splotch on the front of Percy&apos;s trousers - it was small but it was there, and no question</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about what it was - and grinned. &quot;Somebody ought to buy the tough boy a didy,&quot; he said, and went back</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his bunk, chuffing laughter.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal went down to Delacroix&apos;s cell, but the Cajun had ducked inside and thrown himself on his bunk</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before Brutal could get there.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I reached out and grasped Percy&apos;s shoulder. &quot;Percy-&quot; I began, but that was as far as I got. He came to life,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shaking my hand off. He looked down at the front of his pants, saw the spot spreading there, and blushed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a dark, fiery red. He looked up at me again, then at Harry and Dean. I remember being glad that Old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Toot-Toot was gone. If he&apos;d been around, the story would have been all over the prison in a single day.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And, given Percy&apos;s last name-an unfortunate one, in this context - it was a story that would have been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told with the relish of high glee for years to come.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You talk about this to anyone, and you&apos;ll all be on the breadlines in a week,&quot; he whispered fiercely. It</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y287 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was the sort of crack that would have made me want to swat him under other circumstances, but under</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y66 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these, I only pitied him. I think he saw that pity, and it made it worse with him - like having an open</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wound scoured with nettles.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&apos;&quot;What goes on here stays here,&quot; Dean said quietly. &quot;You don&apos;t have to worry about that.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy looked back over his shoulder, toward Delacroix&apos;s cell. Brutal was just locking the door, and from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y200 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inside, deadly clear, we could still hear Delacroix giggling. Percy&apos;s look was as black as thunder. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought of telling him that you reaped what you sowed in this life, and then decided this might not be the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right time for a scripture lesson.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;As for him - &quot; he began, but never finished.

Yes indeed it was.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bill Dodge was standing in the door to the exercise yard, drinking coffee and smoking him a little smoke.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He looked around at me and said, &quot;Well, lookit here.

He told Rolfe Wettermark that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he ate strawberry jam out of his wife&apos;s pussy.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What did Rolfe say?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That he wasn&apos;t married. Said it must have been his mother Wharton was thinking of.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I laughed, and hard. That really was funny, in a low sort of way. And it was good just to be able to laugh</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without feeling like someone was lighting matches way down low in my gut. Bill laughed with me, then</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turned the rest of his coffee out in the yard, which was empty except for a few shuffling trusties, most of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whom had been there for a thousand years or so.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1db ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thunder rumbled somewhere far off, and unfocused heat lightning flashed in the darkening sky</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ab ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">overhead.

No, what he cared about - you&apos;ve guessed already, I&apos;m sure - was what was going to happen to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mr. Jingles after he, Delacroix, passed on. I was used to spending long hours with the condemned on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night before their last march, but this was the first time I&apos;d spent those long hours pondering the fate of a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Del considered scenario after scenario, patiently working the possibilities through his dim mind. And</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">while he thought aloud, wanting to provide for his pet mouse&apos;s future as if it were a child that had to be</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">put through college, he threw that colored spool against the wall. Each time he did it, Mr. Jingles would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spring after it, track it down, and then roll it back to Del&apos;s foot. It started to get on my nerves after awhile</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">-first the clack of the spool against the stone wall, then the minute clitter of Mr. Jingles&apos;s paws. Although</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it was a cute trick, it palled after ninety minutes or so. And Mr. Jingles never seemed to get tired. He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">paused every now and then to refresh himself with a drink of water out of a coffee saucer Delacroix kept</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for just that purpose, or to munch a pink crumb of peppermint candy, and then back to it he went. Several</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">times it was on the tip of my tongue to tell Delacroix to give it a rest, and each time I reminded myself</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he had this night and tomorrow to play the spool-game with Mr. Jingles, and that was all. Near the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end, though, it began to be really difficult to hold onto that thought - you know how it is, with a noise</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y70 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that&apos;s repeated over and over. After a while it shoots your nerve. I started to speak after all, then</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y71 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something made me look over my shoulder and out the cell door. John Coffey was standing at his cell</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y148 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">door across the way, and he shook his head at me: right, left, back to center. As if he had read my mind</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y149 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and was telling me to think again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I would see that Mr. Jingles got to Delacroix&apos;s maiden aunt, I said, the one who had sent him the big bag</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of candy. His colored spool could go as well, even his &quot;house&quot; - we&apos;d take up a collection and see that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Toot gave up his claim on the Corona box. No, said Delacroix after some consideration (he had time to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">throw the spool against the wall at least five times, with Mr. Jingles either nosing it back or pushing it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y44 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with his paws), that wouldn&apos;t do. Aunt Hermione was too old, she wouldn&apos;t understand Mr. Jingles&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y72 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frisky ways, and suppose Mr. Jingles outlived her? What would happen to him then? No, no, Aunt</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y73 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hermione just wouldn&apos;t do.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Well, then, I asked, suppose one of us took it? One of us guards? We could keep him right here on E</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y48 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Block. No, Delacroix said, he thanked me kindly for the thought, <span class="ff4">certainement,</span> but Mr. Jingles was a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y49 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse that yearned to be free. He, Eduard Delacroix, knew this, because Mr. Jingles had - you guessed it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- whispered the information in his ear.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y87 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;All right,&quot; I said, &quot;one of us will take him home, Del.

And suppose the kid lost interest and forgot to feed him for two or three</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y99 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days at a stretch? Delacroix, who had roasted six human beings alive in an effort to cover up his original</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crime, shuddered with the delicate revulsion of an ardent anti-vivisectionist.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He threw the comment out in a casual just-an-idea tone of voice.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Mouseville?&quot; Delacroix asked, giving Brutal a look both startled and interested. &quot;What Mouseville?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It&apos;s this tourist attraction down in Florida,&quot; he said. &quot;Tallahassee, I think.

Just a matter of time, really.&quot; He turned and walked back up the Green Mile, not hurrying,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leaving Mr. Jingles lying on the linoleum in a spreading pool of his own blood.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

I wanted to see just how long it has been since my grandchildren, Christopher and Danielle,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y366 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more or less forced me into Georgia Pines. &quot;For your own good, Gramps,&quot; they said. Of course they did.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y367 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isn&apos;t that what people mostly say when they have finally figured out how to get rid of a problem that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y368 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">walks and talks?</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y369 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It&apos;s been a little over two years. The eerie thing is that I don&apos;t know if it <span class="ff4">feels</span> like two years, or longer</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than that, or shorter. My sense of time seems to be <span class="ff4">melting,</span> like a kid&apos;s snowman in a January thaw. It&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as if time as it always was - Eastern Standard Time, Daylight Saving Tune, Working-Man Time - doesn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exist anymore. Here there is only Georgia Pines Time, which is Old Man Time, Old Lady Time, and Piss</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bed Tune. The rest <span class="ff4">...</span> all gone.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This is a dangerous damned place. You don&apos;t you think it&apos;s only a boring dangerous as a nursery school at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">naptime, but it&apos;s dangerous, all right. I&apos;ve seen a lot of people slide into senility since I came here, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y370 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sometimes they do more than slide sometimes they go down with the speed of a crash-diving submarine.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y371 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They come here mostly all right - dim-eyed and welded to the cane, maybe a little loose in the bladder,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y372 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but otherwise okay - and then something happens to them. A month later they&apos;re just sitting in the TV</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y373 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">room, staring up at Oprah Winfrey on the TV with dull eyes, a slack jaw, and a forgotten glass of orange</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y374 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">juice tilted and dribbling in one hand. A month after that, you have to tell them their kids&apos; names when</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y375 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the kids come to visit. And a month after that, it&apos;s their own damned names you have to refresh them on.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y376 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Something happens to them, all right: Georgia Pines Time happens to them. Time here is like a weak</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y377 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acid that erases first memory and then the desire to go on living.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y378 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You have to fight it. That&apos;s what I tell Elaine Connelly, my special friend. It&apos;s gotten better for me since I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y379 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">started writing about what happened to me in 1932, the year John Coffey came on the Green Mile. Some</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the memories are awful, but I can feel them sharpening my mind and my awareness the way a knife</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sharpens a pencil, and that makes the pain worthwhile. Writing and memory alone aren&apos;t enough, though.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I also have a body, wasted and grotesque, though it may now be, and I exercise it as much as I can. It was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hard at first - old fogies like me aren&apos;t much shakes when it comes to exercise just for the sake of exercise</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- but it&apos;s easier now that there&apos;s a purpose to my walks.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I go out before breakfast - as soon as it&apos;s light, most days - for my first stroll. It was raining this morning,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y380 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the damp makes my joints ache, but I hooked a poncho from the rack by the kitchen door and went</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y381 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out, anyway. When a man has a chore, he has to do it, and if it hurts, too bad. Besides, there are</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y382 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">compensations. The chief one is keeping that sense of Real Time, as opposed to Georgia Pines Time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y383 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And I like the rain, aches or no aches. Especially in the early morning, when the day is young and seems</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y384 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">full of possibilities, even to a washed-up old boy like me.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

I crossed the croquet course, then the weedy little putting green. Beyond that is a small</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand of woods, with a narrow path winding through it and a couple of sheds, no longer used and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouldering away quietly, along the way. I walked down this path slowly, listening to the sleek and secret</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patter of the rain in the pines, chewing away at a piece of toast with my few remaining teeth. My legs</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y385 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ached, but it was a low ache, manageable. Mostly I felt pretty well. I drew the moist gray air as deep as I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y386 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could, taking it in like food.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And when I got to the second of those old sheds, I went in for awhile, and I took care of my business</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2cf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y241 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When I walked back up the path twenty minutes later, I could feel a worm of hunger stirring in my belly,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and thought I could eat something a little more substantial than toast. A dish of oatmeal, perhaps even a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y387 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scrambled egg with a sausage on the side. I love sausage, always have, but if I eat more than one these</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y388 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days, I&apos;m apt to get the squitters. One would be safe enough, though. Then, with my belly full and with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y389 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the damp air still perking up my brain (or so I hoped), I would go up to the solarium and write about the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">execution of Eduard Delacroix. I would do it as fast as I could, so as not to lose my courage.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was Mr. Jingles I was thinking about as I crossed the croquet course to the kitchen door - how Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wetmore had stamped on him and broken his back, and how Delacroix had screamed when he realized</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what his enemy had done - and I didn&apos;t see Brad Dolan standing there, half-hidden by the Dumpster, until</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he reached out and grabbed my wrist.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Out for a little stroll, Paulie?&quot; he asked.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y390 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I jerked back from him, yanking my wrist out of his hand. Some of it was just being startled - anyone</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y391 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will jerk when they&apos;re startled - but that wasn&apos;t all of it. I&apos;d been thinking about Percy Wetmore,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y392 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remember, and it&apos;s Percy that Brad always reminds me of. Some of it&apos;s how Brad always goes around</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y393 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with a paperback stuffed into his pocket (with Percy it was always a men&apos;s adventure magazine; with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y394 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brad it&apos;s books of jokes that are only funny if you&apos;re stupid and mean-hearted), some of it&apos;s how he acts</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y395 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like he&apos;s King Shit of Turd Mountain, but mostly it&apos;s that he&apos;s sneaky, and he likes to hurt.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y396 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He&apos;d just gotten to work, I saw, hadn&apos;t even changed into his orderly&apos;s whites yet. He was wearing jeans</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y397 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and a cheesy-looking Western-style shirt. In one hand was the remains of a Danish he&apos;d hooked out of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y398 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kitchen. He&apos;d been standing under the leave, eating it where he wouldn&apos;t get wet. And where he could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y399 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">watch for me, I&apos;m pretty sure of that now. I&apos;m pretty sure of something else, as well: I&apos;ll have to watch out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Mr. Brad Dolan. He doesn&apos;t like me much. I don&apos;t know why, but I never knew why Percy Wetmore</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">didn&apos;t like Delacroix, either. And <span class="ff4">dislike is</span> really too weak a word. Percy hated Del&apos;s guts from the very</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first moment the little Frenchman came onto the Green Mile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&apos;&quot;What&apos;s with this poncho you got on, Paulie?&quot; he asked, flicking the collar. &quot;This isn&apos;t yours.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I got it in the hall outside the kitchen,&quot; I said. I hate it when he calls me Paulie, and I think he knows it,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I was damned if I&apos;d give him the satisfaction of seeing it. &quot;There&apos;s a whole row of them.

I just wanted to get away from him. The more I listened to him, the more he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounded like Percy. William Wharton, the crazyman who came to the Green Mile in the fall of `32, once</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grabbed Percy and scared him so bad that Percy squirted in his pants. <span class="ff4">You talk about this to anyone,</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy told the rest of us afterward, <span class="ff4">and you&apos;ll all be on the breadlines in a week. Now,</span> these many years</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">later, I could almost hear Brad Dolan saying those same words, in that same tone of voice. It&apos;s as if, by</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">writing about those old times, I have unlocked some unspeakable door that connects the past to the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present - Percy Wetmore to Brad Dolan, Janice Edgecombe to Elaine Connelly, Cold Mountain</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Penitentiary to the Georgia Pines old folks&apos; home. And if that thought doesn&apos;t keep me awake tonight, I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guess nothing will.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y219 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I made as if to go in through the kitchen door and Brad grabbed me by the wrist again. I don&apos;t know</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the first one, but this time he was doing it on purpose, squeezing to hurt. His eyes shifting back and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forth, making sure no one was around in the early-morning wet, no one to see he was abusing one of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">old folks he was supposed to be taking care of.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What do you do down that path?&quot; he asked. &quot;I know you don&apos;t go down there and jerk off, those days</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are long behind you, so what do you do?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Nothing,&quot; I said, telling myself to be calm, not to show him how bad he was hurting me and to be calm,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to remember he&apos;d only mentioned the path, he didn&apos;t know about the shed. &quot;I just walk.

Brad wasn&apos;t afraid of breaking the rules; he was only afraid of being caught breaking them. And in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that, too, he was like Percy Wetmore, who would never let you forget he was the governor&apos;s nephew.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y203 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Old as you are, its a miracle you can remember who you are.

No taking the ponchos off the hook outside the kitchen; no secrets, either. No getting</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the idea that the likes of us are still human.

Neither Dean nor Harry, who had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been just about to go out, paid the slightest attention to the overturn of the game. &quot;What&apos;d you do this</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time?&quot; Dean shouted at Percy. &quot;What the hell&apos;d you do this time, you stoopnagel?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy didn&apos;t answer. He strode past the desk without saying a word, patting his hair with his fingers. He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">went through my office and into the storage shed. William Wharton answered for him. &quot;Boss Dean? I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think what he did was teach a certain french-fry it ain&apos;t smart to laugh at him,&quot; he said, and then began to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laugh himself. It was a good laugh, a country laugh, cheery and deep. There were people I met during</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that period of my life (very scary people, for the most part) who only sounded normal when they</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laughed. Wild Bill Wharton was one of those.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked down at the mouse again, stunned. It was still breathing, but there were little minute beads of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blood caught in the filaments of its whiskers, and a dull glaze was creeping over its previously brilliant</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oildrop eyes. Brutal picked up the colored spool, looked at it, then looked at me. He looked as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dumbfounded as I felt. Behind us, Delacroix went on screaming out his grief and horror. It wasn&apos;t just the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y287 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse, of course; Percy had smashed a hole in Delacroix&apos;s defenses and all his terror was pouring out.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Mr. Jingles was the focusing point for those pent-up feelings, and it was terrible to listen to him.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oh no,&quot; he cried over and over again, amid the screams and the garbled pleas and prayers in Cajun</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">French. &quot;Oh no, oh no, poor Mr. Jingles, poor old Mr. Jingles, oh no.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Give im to me.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked up, puzzled by that deep voice, at first not sure who it belonged to. I saw John Coffey.

He simply held them out as far as he could, the hands at the ends of them open. It was a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purposeful pose, an almost urgent pose. And his voice, had the same quality, which was why, I suppose, I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y203 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">didn&apos;t recognize it as belonging to Coffey at first. He seemed a different man from the lost, weepy soul</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that had occupied this cell for the last few weeks.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Give im to me, Mr. Edgecombe!

Coffey lifted</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his hands toward his face, spreading the fingers of the right as he did so, creating spaces like those</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between prison bars. The tail of the mouse now hung from the side of his hands that was facing us.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal stepped next to me, still holding the colored spool between his fingers. &quot;What&apos;s he think he&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doing?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Shh,&quot; I said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y101 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix had stopped screaming. &quot;Please, John,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Oh Johnny, help him, please help him,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oh <span class="ff4">s&apos;il vous plait.&quot;</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean and Harry joined us, Harry with our old deck of Airplane cards still in one hand. &quot;What&apos;s going</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on?&quot; Dean asked, but I only shook my head.

Delacroix looked, saw it, took it, and went back to Mr. Jingles again, stroking</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his fur and devouring him with his eyes, needing to constantly refresh his perception that yes, the mouse</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was all right, the mouse was whole and fine and all right.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Toss it,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;I want to see how he runs.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He all right, Boss Howell, he all right, praise God--!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Toss it,&quot; Brutal repeated. &quot;Mind me, Del.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix bent, clearly reluctant, clearly not wanting to let Mr. Jingles out of his hands again, at least not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yet. Then, very gently, he tossed the spool. It rolled across the cell, past the Corona cigar box, and to the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wall. Mr. Jingles was after it, but not quite with the speed he had shown previously. He appeared to be</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">limping just a bit on his left rear leg, and that was what struck me the hardest - it was, I suppose, what</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made it real. That little limp.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He got to the spool, though, got to it just fine and nosed it back to Delacroix with all his old enthusiasm. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turned to John Coffey, who was standing at his cell door and smiling. It was a tired smile, and not what</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I&apos;d call really happy, but the sharp urgency I&apos;d seen in his face as he begged for the mouse to be given to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him was gone, and so was the look of pain and fear, as if he were choking. It was our john Coffey again,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with his not-quite-there face and strange, far-looking eyes.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You helped it,&quot; I said. &quot;Didn&apos;t you, big boy?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y117 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Coffey said. The smile widened a little, and for a moment or two it was happy. &quot;I helped</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it. I helped Del&apos;s mouse. I helped ...&quot; He trailed off, unable to remember the name.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y118 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Mr. Jingles,&quot; Dean said. He was looking at John with careful, wondering eyes, as if he expected Coffey</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yde ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to burst into flames or maybe begin to float in his cell.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y119 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Coffey said. &quot;Mr. Jingles. He&apos;s a circus mouse. Goan live in ivy-glass.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You bet your bobcat,&quot; Harry said, joining us in looking at John Coffey. Behind us, Delacroix lay down</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on his bunk with Mr. Jingles on his chest. Del was crooning to him, singing him some French song that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounded like a lullaby.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Coffey looked up the Green Mile toward the duty desk and the door which led into my office and the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">storage room beyond. &quot;Boss Percy&apos;s bad,&quot; he said. &quot;Boss Percy&apos;s mean.

He had found a can of paste furniture polish on a shelf above the hamper where we put our</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dirty uniforms (and, sometimes, our civilian clothes; the prison laundry didn&apos;t care what it washed), and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was polishing the oak arms and legs of the electric chair. This probably sounds bizarre to you, perhaps</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even macabre, but to Brutal and me, it seemed the most normal thing Percy had done all night. Old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sparky would be meeting his public tomorrow, and. Percy would at least appear to be in charge.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Percy,&quot; I said quietly.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y100 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He turned the little tune he&apos;d been humming dying in his throat, and looked at us. I didn&apos;t see the fear I&apos;d</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y101 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected, at least not at first. I realized that Percy looked older, somehow. And, I thought, John Coffey</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was right. He looked mean. Meanness is like an addicting drug - no one on earth is more qualified to say</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that than me - and I thought that, after a certain amount of experimentation, Percy had gotten hooked on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it. He liked what he had done to Delacroix&apos;s mouse. What he liked even more was Delacroix&apos;s dismayed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">screams.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t start in on me,&quot; he said in a tone of voice that was almost pleasant. &quot;I mean, hey, it was just a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse. It never belonged here in the first place, as you boys well know.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The mouse is fine,&quot; I said. My heart was thumping hard in my chest but I made my voice come out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mild, almost disinterested. &quot;Just fine. Running and squeaking and chasing its spool again. You&apos;re no</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better at mouse-killing than you are at most of the other things you do around here.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y108 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He was looking at me, amazed and disbelieving. &quot;You expect me to believe that? The goddam thing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crunched!<span class="ff3"> I heard it! So you can just---!&quot;</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Shut up.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He stared at me, his eyes wide. &quot;What?

I couldn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remember the last time I&apos;d felt so angry. &quot;Aren&apos;t you glad Mr. Jingles is okay? After all the talks we&apos;ve</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had about how our job is to keep the prisoners calm, especially when it gets near the end for them, I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y163 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought you&apos;d be glad. Relieved. With Del having to take the walk tomorrow, and all.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy looked from me to Brutal, his studied calmness dissolving into uncertainty. &quot;What the hell game</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do you boys think you&apos;re playing?&quot; he asked.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;None of this is a game, my friend,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;You thinking it is ... well, that&apos;s just one of the reasons</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you can&apos;t be trusted. You want to know the absolute truth? I think you&apos;re a pretty sad case.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You want to watch it,&quot; Percy said. Now there was a rawness in his voice. Fear creeping back in, after all</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y110 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- fear of what we might want with him, fear of what we might be up to. I was glad to hear it. It would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y111 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make him easier to deal with. &quot;I know people.

Brutal and I stood by Old Sparky, waiting for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to come back and not talking. I don&apos;t know about Brutal, but I couldn&apos;t think of a thing to say. I didn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even know how to think about what we had just seen.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y126 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Three minutes passed.

He had time to finish one and start another before Percy came back. He stumbled and almost fell</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y128 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming down the steps from the office to the storageroom floor, and when he crossed to us he came at an</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uneven strut. His face was shocked and unbelieving.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You switched them,&quot; he said in a shrill, accusatory voice. &quot;You switched mice somehow, you bastards.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You&apos;re playing with me, and you&apos;re going to be goddam sorry if you don&apos;t stop!

Not real hard; but it was a clamp, all</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right.

His calm was gone; the meanness and the arrogance,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3ce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">too. Those things were real enough, but you have to remember that Percy was very young. At his age</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3cf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they were still only a thin veneer, like an ugly shade of enamel paint. You could still chip through.

That Wharton got a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pretty good shot at it before anyone pulled him off, although you were right there, and on Wharton&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blind side.

I didn&apos;t like it much, because any idea which seemed good to Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wouldn&apos;t seem good to us.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y54 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;If nothing else,&quot; Brutal said, &quot;just think how nice it&apos;d be to get away from that sack of pus Wharton.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy nodded, and I let him get out of the chair. He straightened his uniform shirt, tucked it in at the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back, gave his hair a pass-through with his comb. Then he looked at us. &quot;Okay, I agree. I&apos;m out front for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Del tomorrow night; I&apos;ll put in for Briar Ridge the very next day. We call it quits right there. Good</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enough?&quot; &quot;Good enough,&quot; I said. That look was still in his eyes, but right then I was too relieved to care.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He stuck out his hand. &quot;Shake on it?&quot; I did. So did Brutal. More fools us.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 y112 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next day was the thickest yet, and the last of our strange October heat. Thunder was rumbling in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">west when I came to work, and the dark clouds were beginning to stack up there. They moved closer as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the night came down, and we could see blue-white forks of lightning jabbing out of them. There was a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tornado in Trapingus County around ten that night - it killed four people and tore the roof off the livery</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stable in Tefton - and vicious thunderstorms and gale-force winds at Cold Mountain. Later it seemed to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me as if the very heavens had protested the bad death of Eduard Delacroix.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Everything went just fine to begin with. Del had spent a quiet day in his cell, sometimes playing with Mr.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jingles but mostly just lying on his bunk and petting him. Wharton tried to get trouble started a couple of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">times - once he hollered down to Del about the mousieburgers they were going to have after old Lucky</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pierre was dancing the two-step in hell - but the little Cajun didn&apos;t respond and Wharton, apparently</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deciding that was his best shot, gave it up.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At quarter past ten, Brother Schuster showed up and delighted us all by saying he would recite the Lord&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Prayer with Del in Cajun French. It seemed like a good omen. In that we were wrong, of course.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The witnesses began to arrive around eleven, most talking in low tones about the impending weather, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speculating about the possibility of a power outage postponing the electrocution. None of them seemed to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know that Old Sparky ran off a generator, and unless that took a direct lightning-hit, the show would go</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on. Harry was in the switch room that night, so he and Bill Dodge and Percy Wetmore acted as ushers,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seeing folks into their seats and asking each one if he&apos;d like a cold drink of water. There were two women</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present: the sister of the girl Del had raped and murdered, and the mother of one of the fire victims. The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">latter lady was large and pale and determined. She told Harry Terwilliger that she hoped the man she&apos;d</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come to see was good and scared, that he knew the fires in the furnace were stoked for him, and that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan&apos;s imps, were waiting for him. Then she burst into tears and buried her face in a lace hanky that was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">almost the size of a pillowslip.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thunder, hardly muffled at all by the tin roof, banged harsh and loud. People glanced up uneasily. Men</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who looked uncomfortable wearing ties this late at night wiped at their florid cheeks. It was hotter than</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blue blazes in the storage shed. And, of course, they kept turning their eyes to Old Sparky. They might</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have made jokes about this chore earlier in the week, but the jokes were gone by eleven-thirty or so that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night. I started all this by telling you that the humor went out of the situation in a hurry for the people</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y144 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who had to sit down in that oak chair, but the condemned prisoners weren&apos;t the only ones who lost the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y145 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smiles off their faces when the time actually came. It just seemed so <span class="ff4">bald,</span> somehow, squatting up there</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y146 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on its platform, with the clamps on the legs sticking off to either side, looking like the things a person</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y147 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with polio would have to wear. There wasn&apos;t much talk, and when the thunder boomed again, as sharp</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

The last person to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">take his seat in the witness&apos;s section was Curtis Anderson, Warden Moores&apos;s stand-in.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y54 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At eleven-thirty, I approached Delacroix&apos;s cell with Brutal and Dean walking slightly behind me. Del was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sitting on his bunk, with Mr. Jingles in his lap. The mouse&apos;s head was stretched forward toward the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">condemned man, his little oilspot eyes rapt on Del&apos;s face. Del was stroking the top of Mr. Jingles&apos;s head</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between his ears. Large silent tears were rolling down Del&apos;s face, and it was these the mouse seemed to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be peering at. Del looked up at the sound of our footsteps. He was very pale. From behind me, I sensed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rather than saw John Coffey standing at his cell door, watching.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Del winced at the sound of my keys clashing against metal, but held steady, continuing to stroke Mr.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jingles&apos;s head, as I turned the locks and ran the door open.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Hi dere, Boss Edgecombe,&quot; he said. &quot;Hi dere, boys. Say hi, Mr. Jingles.&quot; But Mr. Jingles only continued</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to look raptly up at the balding little man&apos;s face, as if wondering at the source of his tears. The colored</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spool had been neatly laid aside in the Corona box - laid aside for the last time, I thought, and felt a pang.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Eduard Delacroix, as an officer of the court...&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Boss Edgecombe?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I thought about just running on with the set speech, then thought again. &quot;What is it, Del?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He held the mouse out to me. &quot;Here. Don&apos;t let nothing happen to Mr. Jingles.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Del, I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll come to me. He&apos;s not - &quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Mais oui, he say he will. He say he know all about you, Boss Edgecombe, and you gonna take him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down to dat place in Florida where the mousies do their tricks. He say he trust you.&quot; He held his hand out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">farther, and I&apos;ll be damned if the mouse didn&apos;t step off his palm and onto my shoulder. It was so light I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y198 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">couldn&apos;t even feel it through my uniform coat, but I sensed it, like a small heat. &quot;And boss? Don&apos;t let that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bad &apos;un near him again. Don&apos;t let that bad &apos;un hurt my mouse.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No, Del. I won&apos;t.&quot; The question was, what was I supposed to do with him right then?

It was John Coffey&apos;s voice, and it was eerie the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way it came right then, as though he had read my mind. &quot;Just for now. If Del don&apos;t mind.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Del nodded, relieved. &quot;Yeah, you take im, John, &apos;til dis foolishment done - bien! And den after ...&quot; His</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gaze shifted back to Brutal and me. &quot;You gonna take him down to Florida. To dat Mouseville Place.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y224 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yeah, most likely Paul and I will do it together,&quot; Brutal said, watching with a troubled and unquiet eye</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as Mr. Jingles stepped off my shoulder and into Coffey&apos;s huge outstretched palm. Mr. Jingles did this</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1af ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with no protest or attempt to run; indeed, he scampered as readily up John Coffey&apos;s arm as he had stepped</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">onto my shoulder. &quot;We&apos;ll take some of our vacation time. Won&apos;t we, Paul?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I nodded.

You yell at me sometimes, oui,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but not &apos;less you have to. You all good men except for dat Percy.

No big deal, but it&apos;s part of my job. Okay?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e9 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oui, monsieur,&quot;<span class="ff3"> he said, and looked at Mr. Jingles, perched on John Coffey&apos;s broad shoulder, for the last</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2ea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time. &quot;Au <span class="ff4">revoir, mon ami,&quot;</span> he said, beginning to cry harder. <span class="ff4">&quot;le t&apos;aime, mon petit.&quot;</span> He blew the mouse a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2eb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kiss. It should have been funny, that blown kiss, or maybe just grotesque, but it wasn&apos;t. I met Dean&apos;s eye</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for a moment, then had to look away. Dean stared down the corridor toward the restraint room and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smiled strangely I believe he was on the verge of tears. As for me, I said what I had to say, beginning</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the part about how I was an officer of the court, and when I was done, Delacroix stepped out of his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3da ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cell for the last time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3db ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Hold on a second longer, hoss,&quot; Brutal said, and checked the crown of Del&apos;s head, where the cap would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3dc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go. He nodded at me, then clapped Del on the shoulder. &quot;Right with Eversharp. We&apos;re on our way.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3dd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So Eduard Delacroix took his last walk on the Green Mile with little streams of mingled sweat and tears</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3de ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">running down his cheeks and big thunder rolling in the sky overhead. Brutal walked on the condemned</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3df ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man&apos;s left, I was on his right, Dean was to the rear.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Schuster was in my office, with guards Ringgold and Battle standing in the corners and keeping watch.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y176 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Schuster looked up at Del, smiled, and then addressed him in French. It sounded stilted to me, but it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worked wonders. Del smiled back, then went to Schuster, put his arms around him, hugged him.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ringgold and Battle tensed, but I raised my hands to them and shook my head.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Schuster listened to Del&apos;s flood of tear-choked French, nodded as if he understood perfectly, and patted</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him on the back. He looked at me over the little man&apos;s shoulder and said, &quot;I hardly understand a quarter</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y17b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of what he&apos;s saying.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t think it matters,&quot; Brutal rumbled.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Neither do I, son,&quot; Schuster said with a grin. He was the best of them, and now I realize I have no idea</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what became of him. I hope he kept his faith, whatever else befell.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He urged Delacroix onto his knees, then folded his hands. Delacroix did the same.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2ff ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Not&apos; Pere, qui etes aux cieux,&quot;<span class="ff3"> Schuster began, and Delacroix joined him. They spoke the Lord&apos;s Prayer</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together in that liquid-sounding Cajun French, all the way to <span class="ff4">&quot;mais deliverez-nous du mal, ainsi soit-il.&quot;</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3ea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By then, Del&apos;s tears had mostly stopped and he looked calm. Some Bible verses (in English) followed,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3eb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not neglecting the old standby about the still waters. When that was done, Schuster started to get up, but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3ec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Del held onto the sleeve of his shirt and said something in French. Schuster listened carefully, frowning.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3ed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He responded. Del said something else, then just looked at him hopefully.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3ee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Schuster turned to me and said: &quot;He&apos;s got something else, Mr. Edgecombe. A prayer I can&apos;t help him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3ef ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with, because of my faith. Is it all right?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked at the clock on the wall and saw it was seventeen minutes to midnight. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;but it&apos;ll</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have to be quick.

A frown creased his forehead and I had a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2cc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sense of him reaching far back in his mind, as a man may search a small attic room for an object which</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2cd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hasn&apos;t been used (or needed) for a long, long time.

He reached</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out with one hand, not looking to see where it went. Brutal took it and squeezed it briefly. Delacroix</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked at him and smiled a little. &quot;Nous <span class="ff4">voyons - &quot;</span> he began, then stopped.

I&apos;m right wit God,&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That&apos;s good,&quot; I said, wondering how right with God Del was going to feel twenty minutes from now,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when he stood on the other side of the electricity. I hoped his last prayer had been heard, and that Mother</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3fa ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mary was praying for him with all her heart and soul, because Eduard Delacroix, rapist and murderer,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right then needed all the praying he could get his hands on. Outside, thunder bashed across the sky again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3fb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on, Del.

By the time they cross the rest of the green carpet</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y393 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and duck through the little door, almost all of them are scared.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3fc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Stop at the bottom, Del,&quot; I told him in a low voice as he went through, but it was advice I needn&apos;t have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3fd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">given him. He stopped at the foot of the stairs, all right, stopped cold, and what did it was the sight of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y396 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy Wetmore standing there on the platform, with the sponge-bucket by one foot and the phone that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y397 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">went to the governor just visible beyond his right hip.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3fe ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Non,&quot;<span class="ff3"> Del said in a low, horrified voice. </span>&quot;Non, non,<span class="ff3"> not him!&quot;</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3ff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Walk on,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;You just keep your eyes on me and Paul.

Percy jumped as if someone had goosed him, and Del gave a small, contemptuous snort</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y405 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of laughter. &quot;It get much louder dan dat, he gonna piddle in his pants again,&quot; he said, and then squared</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y406 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his shoulders - not that he had much to square. &quot;Come on. Let&apos;s get it over.&quot;</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Delacroix ran a nervous eye over the witnesses - about twenty-five of them</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this time - as we went, but Brutal, Dean, and I kept our own eyes trained on the chair. All looked in order</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to me. I raised one thumb and a questioning eyebrow to Percy, who gave a little one-sided grimace, as if</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to say <span class="ff4">What do you mean, is everything all right? Of course it is.</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I hoped he was right.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal and I reached automatically for Delacroix&apos;s elbows as he stepped up onto the platform. It&apos;s only</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eight or so inches up from the floor, but you&apos;d be surprised how many of them, even the toughest of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tough babies, need help to make that last step up of their lives.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Del did okay, though. He stood in front of the chair for a moment (resolutely not looking at Percy), then</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actually spoke to it, as if introducing himself: <span class="ff4">&quot;C&apos;est</span> moi,&quot; he said. Percy reached for him, but Delacroix</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turned around on his own and sat down. I knelt on what was now his left side, and Brutal knelt on his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right. I guarded my crotch and my throat in the manner I have already described, then swung the clamp</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in so that its open jaws encircled the skinny white flesh just above the Cajun&apos;s ankle. Thunder bellowed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and I jumped. Sweat ran in my eye, stinging. Mouseville, I kept thinking for some reason. Mouseville,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and how it cost a dime to get in. Two cents for the kiddies, who would look at Mr. Jingles through his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ivy-glass windows.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The clamp was balky, wouldn&apos;t shut. I could hear Del breathing in great dry pulls of air, lungs that would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be charred bags less than four minutes from now laboring to keep up with his fear-driven heart. The fact</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he had killed half a dozen people seemed at that moment the least important thing about him. I&apos;m not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trying to say anything about right and wrong here, but only to tell how it was.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean knelt next to me and whispered, &quot;What&apos;s wrong, Paul?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I can&apos;t--&quot; I began, and then the clamp closed with an audible snapping sound. It must have also pinched</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a fold of Delacroixs skin in its jaws, because he flinched and made a little hissing noise. &quot;Sorry,&quot; I said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It okay, boss,&quot; Del said. &quot;It only gonna hurt for a minute.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal&apos;s side had the clamp with the electrode in it, which always took a little longer, and so we stood up,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y116 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all three of us, at almost exactly the same time. Dean reached for the wrist-clamp on Del&apos;s left, and Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">went to the one on his right. I was ready to move forward if Percy should need help, but he did better</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with his wrist-clamp than I&apos;d done with my ankle-clamp. I could see Del trembling all over now, as if a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">low current were already passing through him. I could smell his sweat, too. It was sour and strong and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reminded me of weak pickle juice.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean nodded to Percy. Percy turned back over his shoulder - I could see a place just under the angle of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his jaw where he&apos;d cut himself shaving that day - and said in a low, firm voice: &quot;Roll on one!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was a hum, sort of like the sound an old refrigerator makes when it kicks on, and the hanging</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lights in the storage room brightened. There were a few low gasps and murmurs from the audience. Del</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y258 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jerked in the chair, his hands gripping the ends of the oak arms hard enough to turn the knuckles white.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His eyes rolled rapidly from side to side in their sockets, and his dry breathing quickened even more. He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was almost panting now.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Steady,&quot; Brutal murmured. &quot;Steady, Del, you&apos;re doing just fine.

All, that was, but for one set. Delacroix saw who it was and looked down at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his lap instead. I would have bet you a dollar to a doughnut that Percy would flub his lines when he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actually had to say them for an audience, but he reeled them off without a hitch, in an eerily calm voice.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Eduard Delacroix, you have been condemned to die in the electric chair, sentence passed by a jury of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">your peers and imposed by a judge of good standing in this state, God save the people of this state.

The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shadow of a contemptuous smile touched the corners of Percy&apos;s lips, and I could have cheerfully shot him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right there. Then Del licked his lips and tried again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot; I sorry for what I do,&quot; he said. &quot;I give anything to turn back the clock, but no one can. So now - &quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thunder exploded like an airburst mortar shell above us. Del jumped as much as the clamps would allow,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyes starting wildly out of his wet face. &quot;So now I pay the price. God forgive me.&quot; He licked his lips</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again, and looked at Brutal. &quot;Don&apos;t forget your promise about Mr. Jingles,&quot; he said in a lower voice that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was meant just for us.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We won&apos;t, don&apos;t worry,&quot; I said, and patted Delacroix&apos;s clay-cold hand. &quot;He&apos;s going to Mouseville - &quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The hell he is&apos; &quot; Percy said, speaking from the corner of his mouth like a yardwise con as he hooked the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">restraining belt across Delacroix&apos;s chest. &quot;There&apos;s no such place. It&apos;s a fairy-tale these guys made up to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep you quiet. Just thought you should know, faggot.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A stricken light in Del&apos;s eyes told me that part of him <span class="ff4">had</span> known ... but would have kept the knowledge</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the rest of him, if allowed. I looked at Percy, dumbfounded and furious, and he looked back at me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">levelly, as if to ask what I meant to do about it. And he had me, of course. There was nothing I <span class="ff4">could</span> do</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about it, not in front of the witnesses, not with Delacroix now sitting on the furthest edge of life. There</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was nothing to do now but go on with it, finish it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy took the mask from its hook and rolled it down over Del&apos;s face, snugging it tight under the little</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man&apos;s undershot chin so as to stretch the hole in the top. Taking the sponge from the bucket and putting it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the cap was the next, and it was here that Percy diverged from the routine for the first time: instead of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just bending over and fishing the sponge out, he took the steel cap from the back of the chair, and bent</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y200 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over with it in his hands. Instead of bringing the sponge to the cap, in other words-which would have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been the natural way to do it - he brought the cap to the sponge. I should have realized something was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrong, but I was too upset. It was the only execution I ever took part in where I felt totally out of control.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As for Brutal, he never looked at Percy at all, not as Percy bent over the bucket (moving so as to partially</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">block what he was doing from our view), not as he straightened up and turned to Del with the cap in his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands and the brown circle of sponge already inside it. Brutal was looking at the cloth which had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">replaced Del&apos;s face, watching the way the black silk mask drew in, outlining the circle of Del&apos;s open</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y144 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouth, and then puffed out again with his breath. There were big beads of perspiration on Brutal&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y145 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forehead, and at his temples, just below the hairline. I had never seen him sweat at an execution before.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y146 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Behind him, Dean looked distracted and W, as if he was fighting not to lose his supper. We all</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y147 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understood that something was wrong, I know that now. We just couldn&apos;t tell what it was.

There were a lot of them, but I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suspect most were just camouflage. What Percy wanted to know about - the <span class="ff4">only</span> thing Percy wanted to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know about, I believe - was the sponge. The purpose of the sponge. Why it was soaked in brine ... and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what would happen if it was not soaked in brine.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What would happen if the sponge was dry.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy jammed the cap down on Del&apos;s head. The little man jumped and moaned again, this time louder.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some of the witnesses stirred uneasily on their folding chairs. Dean took a half-step forward, meaning to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help with the chin-strap, and Percy motioned him curtly to step back. Dean did, hunching a little and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wincing as another blast of thunder shook the storage shed. This time it was followed by the first spatters</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of rain across the roof. They sounded hard, like someone flinging handfuls of goobers onto a washboard.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You&apos;ve heard people say &quot;My blood ran cold&quot; about things, haven&apos;t you? Sure.

It wasn&apos;t the look of poison triumph on Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wetmore&apos;s face as he stepped away from the capped, clamped, and hooded figure sitting there in Old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sparky; it was what I should have seen and didn&apos;t. There was no water running down Del&apos;s cheeks from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of the cap. That was when I finally got it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Edward Delacroix,&quot; Percy was saying, &quot;electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dead, according to state law.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked over at Brutal in an agony that made my urinary infection seem like a bumped finger The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sponge is dry! I mouthed at him, but he only shook his head, not understanding, and looked back at the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mask over the Frenchman&apos;s face, where the man&apos;s last few breaths were pulling the black silk in and then</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blousing it out again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I reached for Percy&apos;s elbow and he stepped away from me, giving me a flat look as he did so. It was only</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a momentary glance, but it told me everything. Later he would tell his lies and his half-truths, and most</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be believed by the people who mattered, but I knew a different story. Percy was a good student</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y287 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when he was doing something he cared about, we&apos;d found that out at the rehearsals, and he had listened</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y66 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carefully when Jack Van Hay explained how the brine-soaked sponge conducted the juice, channelling it,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turning the charge into a kind of electric bullet to the brain. Oh yes, Percy knew exactly what he was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doing. I think I believed him later when he said I didn&apos;t know how far it would go, but that doesn&apos;t even</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">count in the good-intentions column, does it? I don&apos;t think so. Yet, short of screaming in front of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">assistant warden and all the witnesses for Jack Van Hay not to pull the switch, there was nothing I could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do. Given another five seconds, I think I might have screamed just that, but Percy didn&apos;t give me another</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">five seconds.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;May God have mercy on your soul,&quot; he told the panting, terrified figure in the electric chair, then looked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">past him at the mesh-covered rectangle where Harry and Jack were standing, Jack with his hand on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y160 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">switch marked MABEL&apos;S HAIR DRIER.

More</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smoke was streaming out of the hole in the top of the cap that the wire came in through; it looked like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smoke coming out of the hole in an Indian&apos;s teepee.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix began to jitter and twist in-the chair, his mask-covered face snapping from side to side as if in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some vehement refusal. His legs began to piston up and down in short strokes that were hampered by the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y23f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clamps on his ankles. Thunder banged overhead, and now the rain began to pour down harder.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y240 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked at Dean Stanton; he stared wildly back. There was a muffled pop from under the cap, like a pine</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y241 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knot exploding in a hot fire, and now I could see smoke coming through the mask, as well, seeping out in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little curls.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I lunged toward the mesh between us and the switch room, but before I could open my mouth, Brutus</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Howell seized my elbow. His grip was hard enough to make the nerves in there tingle. He was as white</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as tallow but not in a panic - not even close to being in a panic. &quot;Don&apos;t you tell Jack to stop,&quot; he said in a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">low voice. &quot;Whatever you do, don&apos;t tell him that. It&apos;s too late to stop.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y407 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At first, when Del began to scream, the witnesses didn&apos;t hear him. The rain on the tin roof had swelled to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a roar, and the thunder was damned near continuous. But those of us on the platform heard him, all right</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- choked howls of pain from beneath the smoking mask, sounds an animal caught and mangled in a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3fa ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hay-baler might make.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y408 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The hum from the cap was ragged and wild now, broken by bursts of what sounded like radio static.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y390 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix began to slam back and forth in the chair like a kid doing a tantrum. The platform shook, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y391 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he hit the leather restraining belt almost hard enough to pop it. The current was also twisting him from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y392 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">side to side, and I heard the crunching snap as his right shoulder either broke or dislocated. It went with a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y393 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sound like someone hitting a wooden crate with a sledgehammer. The crotch of his pants, no more than a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y394 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blur because of the short pistoning strokes of his legs, darkened. Then he began to squeal, horrible</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y395 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounds, high-pitched and ratlike, that were audible even over the rushing downpour.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y396 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What the hell&apos;s happening to him?&quot; someone cried.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y409 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Are those clamps going to hold?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1f6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Christ, the <span class="ff4">smell!</span> Phew!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y24f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then, one of the two women: &quot;Is this normal?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix snapped forward, dropped back, snapped forward, fell back.

He had expected <span class="ff4">something,</span> sure, but not this.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The mask burst into flame on Delacroix&apos;s face. The smell of cooking hair and sponge was now joined by</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the smell of cooking flesh. Brutal grabbed the bucket the sponge had been in - it was empty now, of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y403 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">course - and charged for the extra-deep janitor&apos;s sink in the corner.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Shouldn&apos;t I kill the juice, Paul?&quot; Van Hay called through the mesh.

He looked around, saw the chemical fire</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">extinguisher hanging on the wall, and got that instead. Good boy.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The mask had peeled away from Delacroix&apos;s face enough to reveal features that had gone blacker than</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey&apos;s. His eyes, now nothing but misshapen globs of white, filmy jelly, had been blown out of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their sockets and lay on his cheeks. His eyelashes were gone, and as I looked, the lids themselves caught</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fire and began to burn. Smoke puffed from the open V of his shirt. And still the humming of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">electricity went on and on, filling my head, vibrating in there. I think it&apos;s the sound mad people must</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hear, that or something like it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean started forward, thinking in some dazed way that he could beat the fire out of Del&apos;s shirt with his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands, and I yanked him away almost hard enough to pull him off his feet. Touching Delacroix at that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">point would have been like Brer Rabbit punching into the Tar-Baby.

So I sat down, took her warm hands in my cold ones (the heater in my old Ford barely</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worked, and the weather had turned a hundred and eighty degrees since the storm), and told her what she</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

About halfway through I broke down crying, which I hadn&apos;t expected. I was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a little ashamed, but only a little; it was her, you see, and she never taxed me with the times that I slipped</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the way I thought a man should be ... the way I thought I should be, at any rate. A man with a good</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife is the luckiest of God&apos;s creatures, and one without must be among the most miserable, I think, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only true blessing of their lives that they don&apos;t know how poorly off they are. I cried, and she held my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">head against her breast, and when my own storm passed, I felt better ... a little, anyway. And I believe</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that was when I had the first conscious sight of my idea. Not the shoe; I don&apos;t mean that. The shoe was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y81 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">related, but different. All my real idea was right then, however, was an odd realization: that John Coffey</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y82 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Melinda Moores, different as they might have been in size and sex and skin color, had exactly the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y228 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same eyes: woeful, sad, and distant. Dying eyes.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come to bed,&quot; my wife said at last. &quot;Come to bed with me, Paul.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So I did, and we made love, and when it was over she went to sleep. As I lay there watching the moon</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grin and listening to the walls tick - they were at last pulling in, exchanging summer for fall - I thought</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about John Coffey saying he had helped it. I <span class="ff4">helped Del&apos;s mouse. I helped Mr. Jingles. He&apos;s a circus</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse.<span class="ff3"> Sure. And maybe, I thought, we were all circus mice, running around with only the dimmest</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">awareness that God and all His heavenly host were watching us in our Bakelite houses through our</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ivy-glass windows.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I slept a little as the day began to lighten - two hours, I guess, maybe three; and I slept the way I always</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sleep these days here in Georgia Pines and hardly ever did then, in thin little licks. What I went to sleep</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thinking about was the churches youth. The names changed, depending on the whims of my mother and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her sisters, but they were all really the same, all The First Backwoods Church of Praise Jesus, The Lord</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Is Mighty. In the shadow of those blunt, square steeples, the concept of atonement came up as regularly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as the toll of the bell which called the faithful to worship. Only God could forgive sins, could and did,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">washing them away in the agonal blood of His crucified Son, but that did not change the responsibility of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His children to atone for those sins (and even their simple errors of judgement) whenever possible.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Atonement was powerful; it was the lock on the door you closed against the past.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I fell asleep thinking of piney-woods atonement, and Eduard Delacroix on fire as he rode the lightning,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Melinda Moores, and my big boy with the endlessly weeping eyes. These thoughts twisted their way</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into a dream. In it, John Coffey was sitting on a riverbank and bawling his inarticulate mooncalf&apos;s grief</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y46 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up at the early-summer sky while on the other bank a freight-train stormed endlessly toward a rusty</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trestle spanning the Trapingus. In the crook of each arm the black man held the body of a naked,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y48 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blonde-haired girlchild. His fists, huge brown rocks at the ends of those arms&apos; were closed. All around</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y49 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him crickets chirred and noseeums flocked; the day hummed with heat. In my dream I went to him, knelt</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before him, and took his hands. His fists relaxed and gave up their secrets. In one was a spool colored</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">green and red and yellow. In the other was a prison guard&apos;s shoe.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I couldn&apos;t help it,&quot; John Coffey said. &quot;I tried to take it back, but it was too late.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y153 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And this time, in my dream, I understood him.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 y15a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y145 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At nine o&apos;clock the next morning, while I was having a third cup of coffee in the kitchen (my wife said</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y146 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nothing, but I could see disapproval large on her face when she brought it to me), the telephone rang.

Harry wasn&apos;t, not then, at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y288 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">least, but I had the number of his closest neighbor who was.

Harry agreed to come. I dropped the receiver onto the prongs, went to the window, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y435 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked out thoughtfully. Although we&apos;d had the late shift, I hadn&apos;t wakened either Brutal or Dean, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry hadn&apos;t sounded like a fellow freshly turned out of dreamland, either. It seemed that I wasn&apos;t the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y436 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only one having problems with what had happened last night, and considering the craziness I had in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mind, that was probably good.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y437 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal, who lived closest to me, arrived at quarter past eleven.

Janice served us cold beef</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yab ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sandwiches, slaw, and iced tea in the kitchen. Only a day before, we would have had it out on the side</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y438 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">porch and been glad of a breeze, but the temperature had dropped a good fifteen degrees since the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y439 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thunderstorm, and a keen-edged wind was snuffling down from the ridges.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You&apos;re welcome to sit down with us,&quot; I told my wife.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y296 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She shook her head. &quot;I don&apos;t think I want to know what you&apos;re up to - I&apos;ll worry less if I&apos;m in the dark.

Maybe both. I looked at Dean and Harry &quot;The</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y313 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing with Mr. Jingles - what Coffey did - happened pretty fast.

Ain&apos;t that funny?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Nothing funny or strange about it,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;I think that&apos;s what people most always do with the stuff</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they can&apos;t make out - just forget it. Doesn&apos;t do a person much good to remember stuff that doesn&apos;t make</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">any sense. What about it, Paul? Were there bugs when he fixed you?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes. I think they&apos;re the sickness ... the pain ... the hurt.

The death.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;He just touched me. And I felt it. A kind of jolt, like electricity only not painful.

I took in a deep breath and told them what I wanted to do.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They listened, dumbfounded. Even Brutal, who liked to read those magazines with the stories about little</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">green men from space, looked dumbfounded.

You want to balance it off somehow.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And he was right. Of course he was. I knew Melinda Moores better than the others did, but maybe not, in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the end, well enough to ask them to risk their jobs for her - and possibly their freedom, as well. Or my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own job and freedom, for that matter. I had two children, and the last thing on God&apos;s earth that I wanted</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my wife to have to do was to write them the news that their father was going on trial for... well, what</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would it be? I didn&apos;t know for sure. Aiding and abetting an escape attempt seemed the most likely.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the death of Eduard Delacroix had been the ugliest, foulest thing I had ever seen in my life - not just</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my working life but my whole, entire life - and I had been a party to it. We had all been a party to it,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because we had allowed Percy Wetmore to stay even after we knew he was horribly unfit to work in a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place like E Block. We had played the game. Even Warden Moores had been a party to it. &quot;His nuts are</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">going to cook whether Wetmore&apos;s on the team or not,&quot; he had said, and maybe that was well enough,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">considering what the little Frenchman had done, but in the end Percy had done a lot more than cook Del&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nuts; he had blown the little man&apos;s eyeballs right out of their sockets and set his damned face on fire. And</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">why? Because Del was a murderer half a dozen times over? No. Because Percy had wet his pants and the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little Cajun had had the temerity to laugh at him. We&apos;d been part of a monstrous act, and Percy was going</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to get away with it. Off to Briar Ridge he would go, happy as a clam at high tide, and there he would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y440 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have a whole asylum filled with lunatics to practice his cruelties upon. There was nothing we could do</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about that, but perhaps it was not too late to wash some of the muck off our own hands.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;In my church they call it atonement instead of balancing,&quot; I said, &quot;but I guess it comes to the same</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y441 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Do you really think Coffey <span class="ff4">could</span> save her?&quot; Dean asked in a soft, awed voice. &apos;&quot;Just ... what? ... suck</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that brain tumor out of her head?

That&apos;s because he was a resident before the rules changed.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A grandfather clause, I thought.

We began to walk back down the hall. As we did, I decided to give</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y461 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up and put myself in her hands. She was old and brittle, but not stupid.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y462 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As we went down, walking with the glassy care of the relics we have now become, Elaine said: &quot;Wait at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y463 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the foot.

That was good. For the next few hours we&apos;d have to walk a line with him -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y163 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not too hostile, but not too friendly, either.

Twelve-twenty; twelve-thirty. At twelve-forty, John Coffey got up off his bunk and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood at his cell door, hands grasping the bars loosely. Brutal and I walked down to Wharton&apos;s cell and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked in. He lay there on his bunk, smiling up at the ceiling. His eyes were open, but they looked like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y208 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">big glass balls.

Keeping an eye out for Percy.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y233 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Is it time?&quot; Harry asked.

I couldn&apos;t believe what I was doing. It</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y493 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was like a bad dream.

These were lines we&apos;d scripted at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lunch, and that was just what they sounded like to me, scripted lines, but if Percy was scared enough and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confused enough, they still might save Dean Stanton&apos;s job in a pinch. I myself didn&apos;t think so, but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y229 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything was possible.

Brutal grabbed him from behind and hugged him until I had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slapped the tape over his mouth, winding the roll around to the back of his head, just to be sure. He was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">going to have a few less swatches of hair when the tape came off, and a pair of seriously chapped lips</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into the bargain, but I no longer much cared, I&apos;d had a gutful of Percy Wetmore.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We backed away from him.

I closed the door and Brutal locked it. Dean was standing a little way up the Mile, just</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outside of Coffey&apos;s cell. He had already put the master key in the top lock. The four of us looked a each</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other, no one saying anything. There was no need to. We had started the machinery; all we could do now</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was hope that it ran the course we had laid out instead of jumping the tracks somewhere along the line.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You still want to go for that ride, John?&quot; Brutal asked,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Coffey said. &quot;I reckon.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Good,&quot; Dean said.

You and Harry and Percy are over in the laundry, washing your clothes.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Well, that was what folks said, anyway. There was a crap-game in the laundry supply room some nights;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on others it was blackjack or poker or acey-deucey. Whatever it was, the guards who participated were</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said to be washing their clothes. There was usually moonshine at these get-togethers, and on occasion a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">joystick would go around the circle. It&apos;s been the same in prisons since prisons were invented, I suppose.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When you spend your life taking care of mudmen, you can&apos;t help getting a little dirty yourself.

We all gasped. Wharton should have been dead to the world, all but comatose, yet here he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood, swaying back and forth on his feet like a hard-tagged fighter, grinning blearily.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Coffey&apos;s reaction was remarkable. He didn&apos;t pull away, but he also gasped, pulling air in over his teeth</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like someone who has touched something cold and unpleasant. His eyes widened, and for a moment he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked as if he and dumb had never even met, let alone got up together every morning and lain down</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together every night. He had looked <span class="ff4">alive - there - when</span> he had wanted me to come into his cell so he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could touch me. Help me, in Coffeyspeak. He had looked that way again when he&apos;d been holding his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands out for the mouse. Now, for the third time, his face had lit up, as if a spotlight had suddenly been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turned on inside his brain. Except it was different this time. It was <span class="ff4">colder</span> this time, and for the first time I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wondered what might happen if John Coffey were suddenly to run amok. We had our guns, we could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shoot him, but actually taking him down might not be easy to do.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y66 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I saw similar thoughts on Brutal&apos;s face, but Wharton just went on grinning his stoned, loose-lipped grin -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Where do you think you&apos;re going?&quot; he asked.

As for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton, I wasn&apos;t worried about him at all.

Maybe all three. Coffey looked down at the hand on his arm again, the way you might look at a bug</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which could give you a really nasty bite, had it a mind.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That&apos;s right, nigger,&quot; Wharton said with a bleary, cocky smile. &quot;Bad as you&apos;d want.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was suddenly positive that something awful was going to happen, something that would change the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">planned course of this early morning as completely as a cataclysmic earthquake can change the course of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a river.

Even less did I like what I saw on his arms when I got close to him: goosebumps.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on, big boy,&quot; I said. I took his wrist and attempted to pull him in the direction of the door leading</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down to the tunnel. At first he wouldn&apos;t go, and I might as well have been trying to pull a boulder out of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3da ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ground with my bare hands.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3db ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on, John, we gotta go, &apos;less you want the coach-and-four to turn back into a pumpkin,&quot; Harry said,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3dc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giving his nervous laugh again. He took John&apos;s other arm and tugged, but John still wouldn&apos;t come. And</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y46f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then he said something in a low and dreaming voice. It wasn&apos;t me he was speaking to, it wasn&apos;t any of us,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y470 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I have still never forgotten it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3df ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;They&apos;re still in there. Pieces of them, still in there. I hear them screaming.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry&apos;s nervous chuckles ceased, leaving him with a smile that hung on his mouth like a crooked shutter</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y176 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hangs on an empty house. Brutal gave me a look that was almost terrified, and stepped away from John</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Coffey. For the second time in less than five minutes, I sensed the whole enterprise on the verge of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">collapse. This time I was the one who stepped in; when disaster threatened a third time, a little later on, it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y475 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be Harry. We all got our chance that night, believe me.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I slid in between John and his view of the chair, standing on my tiptoes to make sure I was completely</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y17b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blocking his sight-line. Then I snapped my fingers in front of his eyes, twice, sharply.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on!&quot; I said. &quot;Walk! You said you didn&apos;t need to be chained, now prove it! Walk, big boy! Walk,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey! Over there! That door!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His eyes cleared. &quot;Yes, boss.&quot; And praise God, he began to walk.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Look at the door, John Coffey, just at the door and nowhere else.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2ff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, boss.&quot; John fixed his eyes obediently on the door.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y300 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Brutal,&quot; I said, and pointed.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y478 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He hurried in advance, shaking out his keyring, finding the right one. John kept his gaze fixed on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">door to the tunnel and I kept my gaze fixed on John, but from the comer of one eye I could see Harry</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">throwing nervous glances at the chair, as if he had never seen it before in his life.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h9 y4a8 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There are pieces of them still in there ...

We went down the stairs with Coffey in the lead. At the bottom, he looked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glumly down the tunnel, with its low brick ceiling. He was going to have a crick in his back by the time</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we got to the other end, unless - I pulled the gurney over. The sheet upon which we&apos;d laid Del had been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stripped (and probably incinerated), so the gurney&apos;s black leather pads were visible. &quot;Get on,&quot; I told John.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He looked at me doubtfully, and I nodded encouragement. &quot;It&apos;ll be easier for you and no harder for us.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Okay, Boss Edgecombe.&quot; He sat down, then lay back, looking up at us with worried brown eyes. His</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feet, clad in cheap prison slippers, dangled almost all the way to the floor. Brutal got in between them</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and pushed John Coffey along the dank corridor as he had pushed so many others. The only difference</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was that the current rider was still breathing. About halfway along - under the highway, we would have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been, and able to hear the muffled drone of passing cars, had there been any at that hour - John began to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smile. &quot;Say,&quot; he said, &quot;this is fun.&quot; He wouldn&apos;t think so the next time he rode the gurney; that was the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought which crossed my mind. In fact, the next time he rode the gurney, he wouldn&apos;t think or feel</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything. Or would he? There are pieces of them still in there, he had said; he could hear them</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">screaming.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Walking behind the others and unseen by them, I shivered.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I hope you remembered Aladdin, Boss Edgecombe,&quot; Brutal said as we reached the far end of the tunnel.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; I said. Aladdin looked no different from the other keys I carried in those days - and I had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a bunch that must have weighed four pounds - but it was the master key of master keys, the one that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened everything. There was one Aladdin key for each of the five cellblocks in those days, each the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">property of the block super. Other guards could borrow it, but only the bull-goose screw didn&apos;t have to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y91 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sign it out.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was a steel-barred gate at the far end of the tunnel. It always reminded me of pictures I&apos;d seen of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">old castles; you know, in days of old when knights were bold and chivalry was in flower. Only Cold</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mountain was a long way from Camelot. Beyond the gate, a flight of stairs led up to an unobtrusive</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bulkhead-style door with signs reading No TRESPASSING and STATE PROPERTY and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ELECTRIFIED WIRE on the outside.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y66 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I opened the gate and Harry swung it back. We went up, John Coffey once more in the lead, shoulders</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slumped and head bent. At the top, Harry got around him (not without some difficulty, either, although</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was the smallest of the three of us) and unlocked the bulkhead. It was heavy. He could move it, but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wasn&apos;t able to flip it up.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Here, boss,&quot; John said. He pushed to the front again -bumping Harry into the wall with one hip as he did</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so - and raised the bulkhead with one hand.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You would have thought it was painted cardboard instead of sheet steel.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cold night air, moving with the ridge-running wind we would now get most of the time until March or</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y203 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">April, blew down into our faces. A swirl of dead leaves came with it, and John Coffey caught one of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them with his free hand. I will never forget the way he looked at it, or how he crumpled it beneath his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">broad, handsome nose so it would release its smell.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;Let&apos;s go, forward harch.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y195 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We climbed out.

I could actually see the vague shape of a guard inside one of those towers,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blowing on his hands, but only for a moment; the road-facing windows in the towers were small and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unimportant. Still, we would have to be very, very quiet. And if a car <span class="ff4">did</span> come along now, we could be</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in deep trouble.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come on,&quot; I whispered. &quot;Lead the way, Harry.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We slunk north along the highway in a little congaline, Harry first, then John Coffey, then Brutal, then</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me. We breasted the first rise and walked down the other side, where all we could see of the prison was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the bright glow of the lights in the tops of the trees. And still Harry led us onward.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Where&apos;d you park it?&quot; Brutal stage-whispered, vapor puffing from his mouth in a white cloud.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Baltimore?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It&apos;s right up ahead,&quot; Harry replied, sounding nervous and irritable. &quot;Hold your damn water, Brutus.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Coffey, from what I&apos;d seen of him, would have been happy to walk until the sun came up, maybe</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until it went back down again. He looked everywhere, starting - not in fear but in delight, I am quite sure</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y107 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- when an owl hoo&apos;d. It came to me that, while he might be afraid of the dark inside, he wasn&apos;t afraid of it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out here, not at all. He was caressing the night, rubbing his senses across it the way a man might rub his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">face across the swells and concavities of a woman&apos;s breasts.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yef ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We turn here,&quot; Harry muttered.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A little finger of road - narrow, unpaved, weeds running up the center crown-angled off to the right.

Brutal was beginning to grumble again when Harry</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped, went to the left side of the track, and began to remove sprays of broken-off pine boughs. John</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y229 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Brutal pitched in, and before I could join them, they had uncovered the dented snout of an old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yda ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Farmall truck, its wired-on headlights staring at us like buggy eyes.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I wanted to be as careful as I could, you know,&quot; Harry said to Brutal in a thin, scolding voice. &quot;This may</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be a big joke to you, Brutus Howell, but I come from a very religious family, I got cousins back in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y118 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hollers so damn holy they make the Christians look like lions, and if I get caught playing at something</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yde ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like this-!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y119 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It&apos;s okay,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;I&apos;m just jumpy, that&apos;s all.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Me too,&quot; Harry said stiffly. &quot;Now if this cussed old thing will just start-&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He walked around the hood of the truck, still muttering, and Brutal tipped me a wink.

I had thrown over a life of work and belief because of one bad execution and because I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believed the overgrown lummox sitting beside me might be able to cure a woman&apos;s inoperable brain</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y81 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tumor. Yet watching john watch the stars, I realized with dismay that I no longer <span class="ff4">did</span> believe that, if I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y82 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ever really had; my urinary infection seemed faraway and unimportant now, as such harsh and painful</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y228 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">things always do once they are past (if a woman could really remember how bad it hurt to have her first</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baby, my mother once said, she&apos;d never have a second). As for Mr. Jingles, wasn&apos;t it possible, even likely,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4aa ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that we had been wrong about how badly Percy had hurt him? Or that John - who really did have some</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4ab ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kind of hypnotic power, there was no doubt of that much, at least - had somehow fooled us into thinking</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4ac ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we&apos;d seen something we hadn&apos;t seen at all? Then there was the matter of Hal Moores. On the day I&apos;d</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4ad ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surprised him in his office, I&apos;d encountered a palsied, weepy old man. But I didn&apos;t think that was the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4ae ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truest side of the warden. I thought the real Warden Moores was the man who&apos;d once broken the wrist of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4af ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a skatehound who tried to stab him; the man who had pointed out to me with cynical accuracy that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Delacroix&apos;s nuts were going to cook no matter who was out front on the execution team. Did I think that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hal Moores would stand meekly aside and let us bring a convicted child-murderer into his house to lay</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands on his wife?</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My doubt grew like a sickness as we rode along. I simply did not understand why I had done the things I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had, or why I&apos;d persuaded the others to go along with me on this crazy night journey, and I did not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe we had a chance of getting away with it - not a hound&apos;s chance of heaven, as the oldtimers used to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">say. Yet I made no effort to cry it off, either, which I might have been able to do; things wouldn&apos;t pass</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">irrevocably out of our hands until we showed up at Moores&apos;s house. Something - I think it might have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been no more than the waves of exhilaration coming off the giant sitting next to me - kept me from</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hammering on top of the cab and yelling at Harry to turn around and go back to the prison while there</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was still time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Such was my frame of mind as we passed off the highway and onto County 5, and from County 5 onto</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chimney Ridge Road. Some fifteen minutes after that, I saw the shape of a roof blotting out the stars and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew we had arrived.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y75 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry shifted down from second to low (I think he only made it all the way into top gear once during the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y76 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole trip). The engine lugged, sending a shudder through the whole truck, as if it, too, dreaded what</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y77 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now lay directly ahead of us.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry swung into Moores&apos;s gravelled driveway and parked the grumbling truck behind the warden&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sensible black Buick. Ahead and slightly to our right was a neat-as-a-pin house in the style which I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe is called Cape Cod. That sort of house should have looked out of place in our ridge country,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">perhaps, but it didn&apos;t. The moon had come up, its grin a little fatter this morning, and by its light I could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see that the yard, always so beautifully kept, now looked uncared for. It was just leaves, mostly, that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hadn&apos;t been raked away. Under normal circumstances that would have been Melly&apos;s job, but Melly hadn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y7e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been up to any leaf-raking this fall, and she would never see the leaves fall again. That was the truth of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y7f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the matter, and I had been mad to think this vacant-eyed idiot could change it.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

I would lean over, tap on the driver&apos;s-side window, tell Harry to get</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the hell out before -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey grabbed my forearm in one of his hamhock fists, pulling me back down as effortlessly as I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">might have done to a toddler. &quot;Look, boss,&quot; he said, pointing. &quot;Someone&apos;s up.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I followed the direction of his finger and felt a sinking - not just of the belly, but of the heart. There was a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spark of light in one of the back windows. The room where Melinda now spent her days and nights, most</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">likely; she would be no more capable of using the stairs than she would of going out to rake the leaves</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which had fallen during the recent storm.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They&apos;d heard the truck, of course - Harry Terwilliger&apos;s goddam Farmall, its engine bellowing and farting</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down the length of an exhaust pipe unencumbered by anything so frivolous as a muffler. Hell, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mooreses probably weren&apos;t sleeping that well these nights, anyway.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A light closer to the front of the house went on (the kitchen), then the living-room overhead, then the one</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the front hall, then the one over the stoop. I watched these forward-marching lights the way a man</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing against a cement wall and smoking his last cigarette might watch the lockstep approach of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">firing squad. Yet I did not entirely acknowledge to myself even then that it was too late until the uneven</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chop of the Farmall&apos;s engine faded into silence, and the doors creaked, and the gravel crunched as Harry</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Brutal got out.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John was up, pulling me with him. In the dim light, his face looked lively and eager. Why not? I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remember thinking. Why shouldn&apos;t he look eager? He&apos;s a fool.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal and Harry were standing shoulder to shoulder at the foot of the truck, like kids in a thunderstorm,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and I saw that both of them looked as scared, confused, and uneasy as I felt. That made me feel even</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worse.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John got down. For him it was more of a step than a jump. I followed, stiff-legged and miserable. I would</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have sprawled on the cold gravel if he hadn&apos;t caught me by the arm.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y116 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This is a mistake,&quot; Brutal said in a hissy little voice. His eyes were very wide and very frightened.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Christ Almighty, Paul, what were we thinking?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y117 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Too late now,&quot; I said. I pushed one of Coffey&apos;s hips, and he went obediently enough to stand beside</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harry. Then I grabbed Brutal&apos;s elbow like this was a date we were on and got the two of us walking</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toward the stoop where that light was now burning. &quot;Let me do the talking. Understand?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yde ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;Right now that&apos;s just about the only thing I do understand.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y119 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked back over my shoulder. &quot;Harry, stay by the truck with him until I call for you. I don&apos;t want</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y190 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moores to see him until I&apos;m ready.&quot; Except I was never going to be ready.

There stood Hal Moores in blue pajama pants and a strapstyle</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y164 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tee-shirt, his iron-gray hair standing up in tufts and twists. He was a man who had made a thousand</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y165 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enemies over the course of his career, and he knew it. Clasped in his right hand, the abnormally long</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y166 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">barrel not quite pointing at the floor, was the pistol which had always been mounted over the mantel.

I heard no fear at all in his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voice. And -for the time being, at least - his shakes had stopped. The hand holding the gun was as steady</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a stone. &quot;Answer me, or - &quot; The barrel of the gun began to rise.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Stop it, Warden!&quot; Brutal raised his hands, palms out, toward the man with the gun. I have never heard</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his voice sound the way it did then; it was as if the shakes turned out of Moores&apos;s hands had somehow</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found their way into Brutus Howell&apos;s throat. &quot;It&apos;s us! It&apos;s Paul and me and . . . it&apos;s us!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He took the first step up, so that the light over the stoop could fall fully on his face, I joined him. Hal</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moores looked back and forth between us, his angry determination giving way to bewilderment. &quot;What</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are you doing here?&quot; he asked. &quot;Not only is it the shank of the morning, you boys have the duty. I know</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you do, I&apos;ve got the roster pinned up in my workshop. So what in the name of ... oh, Jesus. It&apos;s not a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lockdown, is it? Or a riot?&quot; He looked between us, and his gaze sharpened. &quot;Who else is down by that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truck?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Let me do the talking.<span class="ff3"> So I had instructed Brutal, but now the time to talk was here and I couldn&apos;t even</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">open my mouth. On my way into work that afternoon I had carefully planned out what I was going to say</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when we got here, and had thought that it didn&apos;t sound too crazy. Not normal - nothing about it was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">normal - but maybe close enough to normal to get us through the door and give us a chance. Give <span class="ff4">John</span> a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chance. But now all my carefully rehearsed words were lost in a roaring confusion. Thoughts and images</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- Del burning, the mouse dying, Toot jerking in Old Sparky&apos;s lap and screaming that he was a done tom</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y91 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turkey - whirled inside my head like sand caught in a dust-devil. I believe there is good in the world, all</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y92 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of it flowing in one way or another from a loving God. But I believe there&apos;s another force as well, one</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y62 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">every bit as real as the God I have prayed to my whole life, and that it works consciously to bring all our</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y63 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decent impulses to ruin. Not Satan, I don&apos;t mean Satan (although I believe he is real, too), but a kind of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y64 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">demon of discord, a prankish and stupid thing that laughs with glee when an old man sets himself on fire</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y152 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trying to light his pipe or when a much-loved baby puts its first Christmas toy in its mouth and chokes to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death on it. I&apos;ve had a lot of years to think on this, all the way from Cold Mountain to Georgia Pines, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I believe that force was actively at work among us on that morning, swirling everywhere like a fog,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trying to keep John Coffey away from Melinda Moores.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y96 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Warden ... Hal ... I ...&quot; Nothing I tried made any sense.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He raised the pistol again, pointing it between Brutal and me, not listening. His bloodshot eyes had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gotten very wide. And here came Harry Terwilliger, being more or less pulled along by our big boy, who</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y13f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was wearing his wide and daffily charming smile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Coffey,&quot; Moores breathed. &quot;John Coffey.&quot; He pulled in breath and yelled in a voice that was reedy but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strong: &quot;Halt! Halt right there, or I shoot!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From somewhere behind him, a weak and wavery female voice called: &quot;Hal?

Just a moment, as I say,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but it should have been long enough for me to snatch the long-barrelled gun out of his hand.

Moores turned away from the sound of his wife&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voice and raised the gun again. He said later that yes, he fully intended to shoot Coffey; he suspected we</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were all prisoners, and that the brains behind whatever was happening were back by the truck, lurking in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the shadows.

Coffey didn&apos;t make him do it; Harry did it on his own.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No, Warden Moores!&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s all right!

Help who?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As if in answer, the old woman&apos;s voice rose again, querulous and certain and utterly lost: &quot;Come in here</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and poke my mudhole, you son of a bitch! Bring your asshole friends, too! Let them all have a turn!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked at Brutal, shaken to my soul.

A lot more.</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Moores asked us again.

Is it a prison break, or...&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y197 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John set Harry aside - just picked him up and moved him over - and then climbed to the stoop. He stood</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between Brutal and me, so big he almost pushed us off either side and into Melly&apos;s holly bushes.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yef ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moores&apos;s eyes turned up to follow him, the way a person&apos;s eyes do when he&apos;s trying to see the top of a tall</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y108 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tree. And suddenly the world fell back into place for me. That spirit of discord, which had jumbled my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thoughts like powerful fingers sifting through sand or grains of rice, was gone. I thought I also</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understood why Harry had been able to act when Brutal and I could only stand, hopeless and indecisive,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y116 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in front of our boss. Harry had been with John... and whatever spirit it is that opposes that other, demonic</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one, it was in John Coffey that night. And, when John stepped forward to face Warden Moores, it was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that other spirit - something white, that&apos;s how I think of it, as something white - which took control of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">situation. The other thing didn&apos;t leave, but I could see it drawing back like a shadow in a sudden strong</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">light.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I want to help,&quot; John Coffey said. Moores looked up at him, eyes fascinated, mouth hanging open.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Coffey plucked the Buntline Special from his hand and passed it to me, I don&apos;t think Hal even</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y201 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew it was gone. I carefully lowered the hammer. Later, when I checked the cylinder, I would find it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y202 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been empty all along. Sometimes I wonder if Hal knew that. Meanwhile, John was still murmuring.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y203 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I came to help her. Just to help. That&apos;s all I want.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Hal!&quot; she cried from the back bedroom. Her voice sounded a little stronger now, but it also sounded</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">afraid, as if the thing which had so confused and unmanned us had now retreated to her. &quot;Make them go</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">away, whoever they are!

I&apos;m not dressed, my tits are out and my bitchbox is taking the breeze!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John paid no attention, just went stolidly along, head bent so he wouldn&apos;t smash any of the light fixtures,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his round brown skull gleaming, his hands swinging at his sides. After a moment we followed him, me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first, Brutal and Hal side by side, and Harry bringing up the rear. I understood one thing perfectly well: it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y107 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was all out of our hands now, and in John&apos;s.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 y197 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The woman in the back bedroom, propped up against the headboard and staring wall-eyed at the giant</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y198 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who had come into her muddled sight, didn&apos;t look at all like the Melly Moores I had known for twenty</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years; she didn&apos;t even look like the Melly Moores Janice and I had visited shortly before Delacroix&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">execution. The woman propped up in that bed looked like a sick child got up as a Halloween witch. Her</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">livid skin was a hanging dough of wrinkles. It was puckered up around the eye on the right side, as if she</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y229 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were trying to wink. That same side of her mouth turned down, one old yellow eyetooth hung out over</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yda ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her liverish lower lip. Her hair was a wild thin fog around her skull. The room stank of the stuff our</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y117 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bodies dispose of with such decorum when things are running right. The chamberpot by her bed was half</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">full of some vile yellowish goo. We had come too late anyway, I thought, horrified. It had only been a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">matter of days since she had been recognizable - sick but still herself Since then, the thing in her head</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must have moved with horrifying speed to consolidate its position. I didn&apos;t think even John Coffey could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help her now.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her expression when Coffey entered was one of fear and horror - as if something inside her had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recognized a doctor that might be able to get at it and pry it loose, after all ... to sprinkle salt on it the way</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y258 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you do on a leech to make it let go its grip. Hear me carefully: I&apos;m not saying that Melly Moores was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">possessed, and I&apos;m aware that, wrought up as I was, all my perceptions of that night must be suspect. But</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I have never completely discounted the possibility of demonic possession, either. There was something in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her eyes, I tell you, something that looked like fear.

That unspeakable</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouth trembled in what might have been a smile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y54 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oh, so big!&quot; she cried. She sounded like a little girl just coming down with a bad throat infection. She</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took her hands -as spongy-white as her face - out from under the counterpane and patted them together.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Pull down your pants! I&apos;ve heard about nigger-cocks my whole life but never seen one!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Behind me, Moores made a soft groaning sound, full of despair.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey paid no attention to any of it. After standing still for a moment, as if to observe her from a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little distance, he crossed to the bed, which was illuminated by a single bedside lamp. It threw a bright</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">circle of light on the white counterpane drawn up to the lace at the throat of her nightgown. Beyond the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bed, in shadow, I saw the chaise longue which belonged in the parlor. An afghan Melly had knitted with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her own hands in happier days lay half on the chaise and half on the floor. It was here Hal had been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sleeping - dozing, at least - when we pulled in.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As John approached, her expression underwent a third change. Suddenly I saw Melly, whose kindness</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had meant so much to me over the years, and even more to Janice when the kids had flown from the nest</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and she had been left feeling so alone and useless and blue. Melly was still interested, but now her</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interest seemed sane and aware.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked in a clear, reasonable voice. &quot;And why have you so many scars on your hands</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and arms? Who hurt you so badly?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I don&apos;t hardly remember where they all come from, ma&apos;am,&quot; John Coffey said in a humble voice, and sat</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down beside her on her bed.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Melinda smiled as well as she could - the sneering right side of her mouth trembled, but wouldn&apos;t quite</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come up. She touched a white scar, curved like a scimitar, on the back of his left hand. &quot;What a blessing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that is! Do you understand why?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Reckon if you don&apos;t know who hurt you or dog you down, it don&apos;t keep you up nights,&quot; John Coffey said</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his almost-Southern voice.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y229 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She laughed at that, the sound as pure as silver in the bad-smelling sickroom. Hal was beside me now,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yda ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">breathing rapidly but not trying to interfere. When Melly laughed, his rapid breathing paused for a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y117 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moment, indrawn, and one of his big hands gripped my shoulder. He gripped it hard enough to leave a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bruise - I saw it the next day - but right then I hardly felt it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y118 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What&apos;s your name?&quot; she asked.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;John Coffey, ma&apos;am.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Coffey like the drink.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, ma&apos;am, only spelled different.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She lay back against her pillows, propped up but not quite sitting up, looking at him. He sat beside her,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looking back, and the light from the lamp circled them like they were actors on a stage - the hulking</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y110 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">black man in the prison overall and the small dying white woman. She stared into John&apos;s eyes with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y111 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shining fascination.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

I felt the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y288 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">muscles bunching on my arms and legs and back. Somewhere, far away, I could feel the warden</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y289 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clutching my arm, and to the side of my vision I could see Harry and Brutal with their arms around each</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other, like little kids lost in the night. Something was going to happen. Something big. We each felt it in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our own way.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey bent closer to her. The springs of the bed creaked, the bedclothes rustled, and the coldly</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smiling moon looked in through an upper pane of the bedroom window. Coffey&apos;s bloodshot eyes</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">searched her upturned haggard face.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y309 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;O, I see it,&quot; he said. Speaking not to her - I don&apos;t think so, anyway - but to himself. &quot;I see it, and I can</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y435 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help. Hold still ... hold right still .. .&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Closer he bent, and closer still. For a moment his huge face stopped less than two inches from hers. He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y290 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">raised one hand off to the side, fingers splayed, as if telling something to wait ... just wait ... and then he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y291 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lowered his face again. His broad, smooth lips pressed against hers and forced them open. For a moment</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y437 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I could see one of her eyes, staring up past Coffey, filling with an expression of what seemed to be</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yaa ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surprise. Then his smooth bald head moved, and that was gone, too.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was a soft whistling sound as he inhaled the air which lay deep within her lungs. That was all for a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yac ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">second or two, and then the floor moved under us and the whole house moved around us. It wasn&apos;t my</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">imagination; they all felt it, they all remarked on it later. It was a kind of rippling thump. There was a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crash as something very heavy fell over in the parlor - the grandfather clock, it turned out to be. Hal</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moores tried to have it repaired, but it never kept time for more than fifteen minutes at a stretch again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Closer by there was a crack followed by a tinkle as the pane of glass through which the moon had been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peeking broke. A picture on the wall - a clipper ship cruising one of the seven seas - fell off its hook and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crashed to the floor; the glass over its front shattered.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I smelled something hot and saw smoke rising from the bottom of the white counterpane which covered</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her. A portion was turning black, down by the jittering lump that was her right foot. Feeling like a man in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a dream, I shook free of Moores&apos;s hand and stepped to the night-table. There was a glass of water there,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surrounded by three or four bottles of pills which had fallen over during the shake. I picked up the water</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and dumped it on the place that was smoking. There was a hiss.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y137 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey went on kissing her in that deep and intimate way, inhaling and inhaling, one hand still held</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4ca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out, the other on the bed, propping up his immense weight. The fingers were splayed; the hand looked to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4cb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me like a brown starfish.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Suddenly, her back arched. One of her own hands flailed out in the air, the fingers clenching and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unclenching in a series of spasms. Her feet drummed against the bed. Then something screamed. Again,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that&apos;s not just me; the other men heard it, as well. To Brutal it sounded like a wolf or coyote with its leg</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">caught in a trap. To me it sounded like an eagle, the way you&apos;d sometimes hear them on still mornings</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back then, cruising down through the misty cuts with their wings stiffly spread.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Outside, the wind gusted hard enough to give the house a second shake - and that was strange, you know,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4cc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because until then there had been no wind to speak of at all.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

The right side of her mouth</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no longer drooped. Her eyes had regained their normal shape, and she looked ten years younger. He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">regarded her raptly for a moment or two, and then he began to cough. He turned his head so as not to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cough in her face, lost his balance (which wasn&apos;t hard; big as he was, he&apos;d been sitting with his butt</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y9f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">halfway off the side of the bed to start with), and went down onto the floor. There was enough of him to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4cd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give the house a third shake. He landed on his knees and hung his head over, coughing like a man in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4ce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">last stages of TB.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I thought, Now <span class="ff4">the bugs.

He only went on coughing in deep retching barks, hardly finding time between fits to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y28e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">snatch in the next breath of air. His dark, chocolatey skin was graying out. Alarmed, Brutal went to him,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dropped to one knee beside him, and put an arm across his broad, spasming back. As if Brutal&apos;s moving</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had broken a spell, Moores went to his wife&apos;s bed and sat where Coffey had sat. He hardly seemed to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ya7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">register the coughing, choking giant&apos;s presence at all. Although Coffey was kneeling at his very feet,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4cf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moores had eyes only for his wife, who was gazing at him with amazement. Looking at her was like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looking at a dirty mirror which has been wiped clean.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4d1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;John!&quot; Brutal shouted. &quot;Sick it up! Sick it up like you done before!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yab ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John went on barking those choked coughs. His eyes were wet, not with tears but with strain. Spit flew</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y438 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from his mouth in a fine spray, but nothing else came out.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal whammed him on the back a couple of times, then looked around at me. &quot;He&apos;s choking! Whatever</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he sucked out of her, he&apos;s choking on it!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y296 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I started forward. Before I got two steps, John knee-walked away from me and into the corner of the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">room, still coughing harshly and dragging for each breath. He laid his forehead against the wallpaper -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wild red roses overspreading a garden wall - and made a gruesome deep hacking sound, as if he were</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trying to vomit up the lining of his own throat. That&apos;ll bring the bugs if anything can, I remember</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4d2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thinking, but there was no sign of them. All the same, his coughing fit seemed to ease a little.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;m all right, boss,&quot; he said, still leaning with his forehead against the wild roses. His eyes remained</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">closed. I&apos;m not sure how he knew I was there, but he clearly did. &quot;Honest I am. See to the lady.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked at him doubtfully, then turned to the bed. Hal was stroking Melly&apos;s brow, and I saw an amazing</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing above it: some of her hair - not very much, but some - had gone back to black.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What&apos;s happened?&quot; she asked him. As I watched, color began to blush into her cheeks. It was as if she</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yb9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had stolen a couple of roses right out of the wallpaper. &quot;How did I get here? We were going to the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hospital up in Indianola, weren&apos;t we? A doctor was going to shoot X-rays into my head and take pictures</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ybb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of my brain.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Shhh,&quot; Hal said. &quot;Shhh, dearie, none of that matters now.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But I don&apos;t <span class="ff4">understand!&quot;</span> she nearly wailed, &quot;We stopped at a roadside stand ... you bought me a dime</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">packet of posies ... and then ... I&apos;m here. It&apos;s dark! Have you had your supper, Hal? Why am I in the guest</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4d4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">room? Did I have the X-ray?&quot; Her eyes moved across Harry almost without seeing him - that was shock,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4d5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I imagine - and fixed on me. &quot;Paul?

I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4ee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remembered Brutal handing the colored spool to Delacroix and saying, &quot;Toss it - I want to see how he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4ef ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">runs.&quot; Mr. Jingles had limped then, but on the next night, the night Del walked the Mile, he had been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4f0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fine.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4f1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Melly put her arms around John and hugged him.

If we wanted to get Coffey back to Cold</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mountain before that happened, we would have to go soon. And I wanted to get him back. Partly because</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the longer this went on the worse our chances of getting away with it became, yes, of course. But I also</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted John in a place where I could legitimately call a doctor for him, if the need arose.

He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked up at the sound of our approach and tried to give us a smile. It hung there for a moment on his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">haggard face and then slipped off.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;How you doing, Big John?&quot; Brutal asked, climbing into the back of the truck again and retrieving his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own blanket.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Fine, boss,&quot; John said listlessly. &quot;I&apos;s fine.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal patted his knee. &quot;We&apos;ll be back soon.

Sugar and cream, too.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You bet, I thought, going around to the passenger side of the cab and climbing in. If we don&apos;t get arrested</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ydb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and thrown in jail ourselves first.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But I&apos;d been living with that idea ever since we&apos;d thrown Percy into the restraint room, and it didn&apos;t worry</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y163 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me enough to keep me awake. I dozed off and dreamed of Calvary Hill. Thunder in the west and a smell</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that might have been juniper berries. Brutal and Harry and Dean and I were standing around in robes and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y119 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tin hats like in a Cecil B. DeMille movie. We were Centurions, I guess. There were three crosses, Percy</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y190 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wetmore and Eduard Delacroix flanking John Coffey. I looked down at my hand and saw I was holding</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y191 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a bloody hammer.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11c ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We got to get him down from there,<span class="ff3"> Paul!

I started to tell Brutal this, and then an extra-hard</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bounce of the truck woke me up.

Brutal hopped down all right, but John Coffey&apos;s knees</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y54 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buckled and he almost fell. It took all three of us to catch him, and he was no more than set solid on his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feet again before he went off into another of those coughing fits, this one the worst yet. He bent over, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coughing sounds muffled by the heels of his palms, which he held pressed against his mouth.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When his coughing eased, we covered the front of the Farmall with the pine boughs again and walked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back the way we had come. The worst part of that whole surreal furlough was - for me, at least - the last</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two hundred yards, with us scurrying back south along the shoulder of the highway. I could see (or</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought I could) the first faint lightening of the sky in the east, and felt sure some early farmer, out to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">harvest his pumpkins or dig his last few rows of yams, would come along and see us. And even if that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">didn&apos;t happen, we would hear someone (in my imagination it sounded like Curtis Anderson) shout</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;<span class="ff4">Holdit right there!&quot;</span> as I used the Aladdin key to unlock the enclosure around the bulkhead leading to the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tunnel.

My hands felt cold and numb and faraway,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y60 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and for the longest time I couldn&apos;t get the key to go into the lock.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oh Christ, headlights!&quot; Harry moaned.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked up and saw brightening fans of light on the road.

He sounded like an engine which has almost run</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of oil. He had held the bulkhead door up effortlessly for us on our way out, but we didn&apos;t even ask</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to help this time; it would have been out of the question. Brutal and I got the door up, and Harry led</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">john down the steps. The big man tottered as he went, but he got down. Brutal and I followed him as fast</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as we could, then lowered the bulkhead behind us and locked it again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Christ, I think we&apos;re gonna - &quot; Brutal began, but I cut him off with a sharp elbow to the ribs.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t say it,&quot; I said. &quot;Don&apos;t even think it, until he&apos;s safe back in his cell.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yde ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;And there&apos;s Percy to think about,&quot; Harry said.

We saw John Coffey drag a woman back, not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y509 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just from the edge of her grave, but from what seemed to us to be the very bottom of it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I wrote and was very faintly aware of the Georgia Pines version of life going on around me.

When I opened them again and raised my head, morning sun</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y512 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glared in at me through the windows. I looked at my watch and saw it was past eight. I had slept, head on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y513 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arms like an old drunk, for what must have been six hours.

Okay?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They nodded again. I took a deep breath and walked down to the Green Mile restraint room.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy looked up, squinting, when the light fell on him. He was sitting on the floor and licking at the tape</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I had slapped across his mouth. The part I&apos;d wound around to the back of his head had come free</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(probably the sweat and brilliantine in his hair had loosened it), and he&apos;d gotten a ways toward getting the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rest off, as well. Another hour and he would&apos;ve been bawling for help at the top of his lungs.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He used his feet to shove himself a little way backward when we came in, then stopped, no doubt</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realizing that there was nowhere to go except for the southeast corner of the room.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I took his gun and stick from Dean and held them out in Percy&apos;s direction. &quot;Want these back?&quot; I asked.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y109 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He looked at me warily, then nodded his head.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Brutal,&quot; I said. &quot;Harry.

Some of it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">probably came from his efforts to get free of the quiet-down coat, or to administer the occasional kicks to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y163 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the door Dean had heard, but I thought most of his sweat had come as a result of plain old fear: fear of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what we might do to him when we came back.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I&apos;ll be okay, they ain&apos;t <span class="ff4">killers,</span> Percy would think... and then, maybe, he&apos;d think of Old Sparky and it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would cross his mind that yes, in a way we <span class="ff4">were</span> killers.

His mouth pressed against Percy&apos;s mouth. I heard a whispering rush -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an exhalatory sound, as of long-held breath. Percy jerked like a fish on a hook, trying to get away, but he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never had a chance; John &apos;s right hand was pressed to the back of his neck, holding him firm. Their faces</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed to melt together, like the faces of lovers I have seen kissing passionately through bars.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy screamed, the sound muffled as it had been through the tape, and made another effort to pull back.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For an instant their lips came apart a little, and I saw the black, swirling tide that was flowing out of John</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Coffey and into Percy Wetmore. What wasn&apos;t going into him through his quivering mouth was flowing in</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y60 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by way of his nostrils. Then the hand on the nape of his neck flexed, and Percy was pulled forward onto</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John &apos;s mouth again; was almost impaled on it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy&apos;s left hand sprang open. His treasured hickory baton fell to the green linoleum. He never picked it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I tried to lunge forward, I guess I <span class="ff4">did</span> lunge forward, but my movements felt old and creaky to myself. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grabbed for my gun, but the strap was still across the burled-walnut grip, and at first I couldn&apos;t get it out</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of its holster. Beneath me, I seemed to feel the floor shake as it had in the back bedroom of the Warden&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neat little Cape Cod. That I&apos;m not sure of, but I know that one of the caged lightbulbs overhead broke.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fragments of glass showered down. Harry yelled in surprise.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y287 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At last I managed to thumb loose the safety strap over the butt of my .38, but before I could pull it out of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y66 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">its holster, John had thrust Percy away from him and stepped back into his cell. John was grimacing and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rubbing his mouth, as if he had tasted something bad.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What&apos;d he do?&quot; Brutal shouted. &quot;What&apos;d he do, Paul?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Whatever he took out of Melly, Percy&apos;s got it now,&quot; I said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy was standing against the bars of Delacroix&apos;s old cell. His eyes were wide and blank-double zeros. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">approached him carefully, expecting him to start coughing and choking the way John had after he&apos;d</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y201 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finished with Melinda, but he didn&apos;t. At first he only stood there.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I snapped my fingers in front of his eyes. &quot;Percy! Hey, Percy! Wake up!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y192 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nothing. Brutal joined me, and reached toward Percy&apos;s empty face with both hands.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y164 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That isn&apos;t going to work,&quot; I said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ignoring me, Brutal clapped his hands sharply together twice, right in front of Percy&apos;s nose. And it <span class="ff4">did</span></div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

His eyelids fluttered and he stared around -dazed, like someone hit over the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">head struggling back to consciousness. He looked from Brutal to me. All these years later, I&apos;m pretty sure</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he didn&apos;t see either of us, but I thought he did then; I thought he was coming out of it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y55 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He pushed away from the bars and swayed a little on his feet. Brutal steadied him. &quot;Easy, boy, you all</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right?&quot; Percy didn&apos;t answer, just stepped past Brutal and turned toward the duty desk. He wasn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">staggering, exactly, but he was listing to port.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal reached out for him. I pushed his hand away. &quot;Leave him alone.&quot; Would I have said the same if I&apos;d</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">known what was going to happen next? I&apos;ve asked myself that question a thousand times since the fall of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1932. There&apos;s never any answer.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy made twelve or fourteen paces, then stopped again, head lowered. He was outside of Wild Bill</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton&apos;s cell by then. Wharton was still making those sousaphone noises. He slept through the whole</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing. He slept through his own death, now that I think of it, which made him a lot luckier than most of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the men who ended up here. Certainly luckier than he deserved.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before we knew what was happening, Percy drew his gun, stepped to the bars of Wharton&apos;s cell, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">emptied all six shots into the sleeping man&quot; just bam-bam-bam, bam-bam-bam, as fast as he could pull</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the trigger. The sound in that enclosed space was deafening; when I told Janice the story the next</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">morning, I could still hardly hear the sound of my own voice for the ringing in my ears.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We ran at him, all four of us. Dean got there first - I don&apos;t know how, as he was behind Brutal and me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when Coffey had hold of Percy - but he did. He grabbed Percy&apos;s wrist, prepared to wrestle the gun out of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y259 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy&apos;s hand, but he didn&apos;t have to. Percy just let go, and the gun fell to the floor. His eyes went across us</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like they were skates and we were ice. There was a low hissing sound and a sharp ammoniac smell as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1be ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy&apos;s bladder let go, then a brrrap sound and a thicker stink as he filled the other side of his pants, as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well. His eyes had settled on a far corner of the corridor. They were eyes that never saw anything in this</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">real world of ours again, so far as I know. Back near the beginning of this I wrote that Percy was at Briar</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ridge by the time that Brutal found the colored slivers of Mr. Jingles&apos;s spool a couple of months later,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y65 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and I didn&apos;t lie about that. He never got the office with the fan in the comer, though; never got a bunch of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y93 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lunatic patients to push around, either. But I imagine he at least got his own private room.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He had connections, after all.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton was lying on his side with his back against the wall of his cell. I couldn&apos;t see much then but a lot</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of blood soaking into the sheet and splattered across the cement, but the coroner said Percy had shot like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Annie Oakley. Remembering Dean&apos;s story of how Percy had thrown his hickory baton at the mouse that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time and barely missed, I wasn&apos;t too surprised. This time the range had been shorter and the target not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y25c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moving. One in the groin, one in the gut, one in the chest, three in the head.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal was coughing and waving at the haze of gunsmoke. I was coughing myself, but hadn&apos;t noticed it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until then.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;End of the line,&quot; Brutal said. His voice was calm, but there was no mistaking the glaze of panic in his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyes.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I looked down the hallway and saw John Coffey sitting on the end of his bunk. His hands were clasped</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between his knees again, but his head was up and he no longer looked a bit sick. He nodded at me</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Aren&apos;t we, Paul?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y216 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My mind had begun to move very fast. I looked at Harry and Dean, who were staring at me like scared</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kids. I looked at Percy, who was standing there with his hands and jaw dangling. Then I looked at my old</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friend, Brutus Howell.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1dc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We&apos;re going to be okay,&quot; I said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y204 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Percy at last commenced coughing. He doubled over, hands on his knees, almost retching. His face began</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y205 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to turn red. I opened my mouth, meaning to tell the others to stand back, but I never got a chance. He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made a sound that was a cross between a dry heave and a bullfrog&apos;s croak, opened his mouth, and spewed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out a cloud of black, swirling stuff. It was so thick that for a moment we couldn&apos;t see his head. Harry said</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y100 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oh God save us&quot; in a weak and watery voice. Then the stuff turned a white so dazzling it was like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y101 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">January sun on fresh snow. A moment later the cloud was gone. Percy straightened slowly up and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">resumed his vacant gaze down the length of the Green Mile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We didn&apos;t see that,&quot; Brutal said. &quot;Did we, Paul?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No. I didn&apos;t and you didn&apos;t. Did you see it, Harry?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No,&quot; Harry said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Dean?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;See what?&quot; Dean took his glasses off and began to polish them. I thought he would drop them out of his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trembling hands, but he managed not to.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot; See what, that&apos;s good. That&apos;s just the ticket. Now listen to your scoutmaster, boys, and get it right the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1da ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first time, because time is short.

The longest one of my whole life, without a doubt. I told it pretty much as I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y413 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have here, finishing with how William Wharton had ended up lying dead on his bunk, riddled with lead</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y220 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from Percy&apos;s sidearm.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y415 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">No, that&apos;s not right. What I actually finished with was the stuff that came out of Percy, the bugs or the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y20f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whatever-it-was. That was a hard thing to tell, even to your wife, but I told it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y234 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As I talked, she brought me black coffee by the half-cup at first my hands were shaking too badly to pick</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y211 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up a whole one without spilling it. By the time I finished, the shaking had eased some, and I felt that I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y342 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could even take some food an egg, maybe, or some soup.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y213 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The thing that saved us was that we didn&apos;t really have to lie, any of us.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y221 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Just leave a few things out,&quot; she said, and nodded. &quot;Little things, mostly, like how you took a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y215 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">condemned murderer out of prison, and how he cured a dying woman, and how he drove that Percy</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

But I did, actually; I didn&apos;t think he was going to come back,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y205 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not in 1932, not in &apos;42 or &apos;52, either. In that I was right. Percy Wetmore stayed at Briar Ridge until it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">burned flat in 1944. Seventeen inmates were killed in that fire, but Percy wasn&apos;t one of them. Still silent</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and blank in every regard-the word I learned to describe that state is catatonic - he was led out by one of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y100 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the guards long before the fire reached his wing. He went on to another institution - I don&apos;t remember the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y101 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">name and guess it doesn&apos;t matter, anyway - and died in 1965. So far as I know, the last time he ever</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoke was when he told us we could clock him out at quitting time... unless we wanted to explain why he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had left early.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The irony was that we never had to explain much of anything. Percy had gone crazy and shot William</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton to death. That was what we told, and so far as it went, every word was true. When Anderson</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked Brutal how Percy had seemed before the shooting and Brutal answered with one word - &quot;Quiet&quot; - I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had a terrible moment when I felt that I might burst out laughing. Because that was true, too, Percy <span class="ff4">had</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been quiet, for most of his shift he&apos;d had a swatch of friction-tape across his mouth and the best he&apos;d been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">able to come up with was <span class="ff4">mmmph, mmmph, mmmph.</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Curtis kept Percy there until eight o&apos;clock, Percy as silent as a cigar-store Indian but a lot more eerie. By</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then Hal Moores had arrived, looking grim but competent, ready to climb back into the saddle. Curtis</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Anderson let him do just that, and with a sigh of relief the rest of us could almost hear. The bewildered,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frightened old man was gone; it was the Warden who strode up to Percy, grabbed him by the shoulders</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with his big hands, and shook him hard.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Son!&quot; he shouted into Percy&apos;s blank face - a face that was already starting to soften like wax, I thought.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Son! Do you hear me? Talk to me if you hear me! I want to know what happened!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nothing from Percy, of course. Anderson wanted to get the Warden aside, discuss how they were going</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to handle it -it was a political hot potato if there had ever been one-but Moores put him off, at least for</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the time being, and drew me down the Mile. John Coffey was lying on his bunk with his face to the wall,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">legs dangling outrageously, as they always did. He appeared to be sleeping and probably was ... but he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wasn&apos;t always what he appeared, as we had found out.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Did what happened at my house have anything to do with what happened here when you got back?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y258 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moores asked in a low voice. &quot;I&apos;ll cover you as much as I can, even if it means my job, but I have to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y194 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I shook my head.

Another was photographing Wharton in his cell.

Or when he wanted me to hand him the mouse. It was being surprised, but not by being</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y551 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">touched ... not <span class="ff4">exactly, </span>anyway ... oh Christ, Jan, I don&apos;t know.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y552 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;All right, we&apos;ll leave it,&quot; she said. &quot;I just can&apos;t imagine why John did it, that&apos;s all.

Which leads to another question, Paul: how can you execute him if you&apos;re right about those</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">girls? How can you possibly put him in the electric chair if someone else</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I jerked in my chair. My elbow struck my bowl and knocked it off onto the floor, where it broke. An idea</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y411 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had come to me.

And the ringmaster? Well, the various gentlemen of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y558 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the press took turns at that job. They weren&apos;t as bad then as they are now - they didn&apos;t allow themselves to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y525 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be as bad - but even back then before Geraldo and Mike Wallace and the rest of them, they could gallop</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">along pretty good when they really got the bit in their teeth.

That was the day I found the piece of paper I&apos;d</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been dreading on the middle of my desk: the DOE on John Coffey. Curtis Anderson had signed it instead</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Hal Moores, but of course it was just as legal either way, and of course it had needed to go through</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hal in order to get to me. I could imagine Hal sitting at his desk in Administration with that piece of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">paper in his hand, sitting there and thinking of his wife, who had become something of a nine days,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wonder to the doctors at Indianola General Hospital. She&apos;d had her own DOE papers handed to her by</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y70 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those doctors, but John Coffey had tom them up. Now, however, it was Coffey&apos;s turn to walk the Green</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y71 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mile, and who among us could stop it? Who among us <span class="ff4">would</span> stop it?</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The date on the death warrant was November 20th. Three days after I got it - the fifteenth, I think I had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Janice call me in sick. A cup of coffee later I was driving north in my badly sprung but otherwise reliable</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y40 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ford.

All I knew for sure</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is that I didn&apos;t feel much like singing as I drove. Not that day.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By three that afternoon I was well up in the ridge country. I got to the Purdom County Courthouse just</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before it closed, looked at some records, then had a visit from the Sheriff, who had been informed by the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">county clerk that a stranger was poking in amongst the local skeletons. Sheriff Catlett wanted to know</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y46 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what I thought I was doing. I told him. Catlett thought it over and then told me something interesting. He</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said he&apos;d deny he&apos;d ever said a word if I spread it around, and it wasn&apos;t conclusive anyway, but it was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y48 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something, all right. It was sure something. I thought about it all the way home, and that night there was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y49 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a lot of thinking and precious little sleeping on my side of the bed.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y86 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next day I got up while the sun was still just a rumor in the east and drove downstate to Trapingus</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y87 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">County. I skirted around Homer Cribus, that great bag of guts and waters, speaking to Deputy Sheriff</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y88 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rob McGee instead.

This time there was a fifth at our council of war: my wife. It was Jan</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who convinced me to tell the others; my first impulse had been not to. Wasn&apos;t it bad enough, I asked her,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that we knew?</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You&apos;re not thinking clear about it,&quot; she&apos;d answered. &quot;Probably because you&apos;re still upset.

Then, taking another of Janice&apos;s biscuits and beginning to put an outrageous amount of butter on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it, Dean said: &quot;Did John see him, do you think?

If he did, he forgot it later.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Sure,&quot; Dean said. &quot;He&apos;s special, but that doesn&apos;t make him bright. He only found out it was Wharton</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when Wharton reached through the bars of his cell and touched him.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y108 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal was nodding. &quot;That&apos;s why John looked so surprised ... so shocked.

Why would he want to? He was from Purdom County, and as far as white</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">boys from up there are concerned, you don&apos;t even see a Negro unless he happens to step into your road.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So why did he do it?

And the Detterick twins were all I could think of that was bad enough to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y193 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">explain what he did. I told myself the idea was nuts, too much of a coincidence, it just couldn&apos;t be. Then I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y194 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remembered something Curtis Anderson wrote in the first memo I ever got about Wharton -that Wharton</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was crazy-wild, and that he&apos;d rambled all over the state before the holdup where he killed all those</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y195 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people. <span class="ff4">Rambled all over the state.</span> That stuck with me.

The end of his career, in other words. I wanted the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beginning.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Lot of trouble?&quot; Brutal asked.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yeah. Vandalism, petty theft, setting haystack fires, even theft of an explosive - he and a friend swiped</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a stick of dynamite and set it off down by a creek. He got going early, ten years old, but what I wanted</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wasn&apos;t there. Then the Sheriff turned up to see who I was and what I was doing, and that was actually</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y113 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lucky. I fibbed, told him that a cell-search had turned up a bunch of pictures in Wharton&apos;s mattress - little</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">girls with no clothes on. I said I&apos;d wanted to see if Wharton had any kind of history as a pederast, because</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there were a couple of unsolved cases up in Tennessee that I&apos;d heard about. I was careful never to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mention the Detterick twins. I don&apos;t think they crossed his mind, either.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y103 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Course not&quot;, Harry said. &quot;Why would they have? That case is solved, after all.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I said I guessed there was no sense chasing the idea, since there was nothing in Wharton&apos;s back file. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mean, there was plenty in the file, but none of it about that sort of thing. Then the Sheriff - Catlett, his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y106 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">name is - laughed and said not everything a bad apple like Bill Wharton did was in the court files, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what did it matter, anyway? He was dead, wasn&apos;t he?</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I said I was doing it just to satisfy my own curiosity, nothing else, and that relaxed him. He took me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back to his office, sat me down, gave me a cup of coffee and a sinker, and told me that sixteen months</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ago, when Wharton was barely eighteen, a man in the western part of the county caught him in the barn</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with his daughter. It wasn&apos;t rape, exactly; the fellow described it to Catlett as &apos;not much more&apos;n</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stinkfinger., Sorry, honey.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That&apos;s all right&quot;, Janice said.

So he went to Catlett, but made it clear he only wanted Wharton warned.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">No one wants a nasty thing like that right out in public, if it can be helped. Anyway, Sheriff C. had been</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dealing with Wharton&apos;s antics for quite some time - had him in the reform school up that way for eight</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">months or so when Wharton was fifteen - and he decided enough was enough.

A nice enough fellow. Very quiet. Three days, work it had been. No, the fellow</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y563 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hadn&apos;t slept at the house, Detterick wasn&apos;t foolish enough to believe that nice and quiet always meant</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y564 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">safe, especially in those days, when there was so much dust-bowl riffraff on the roads. A man with a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y565 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family had to be careful.

I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seen him that day, I was in the trees and I seen him drop them down and run away, but - &quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You forgot,&quot; I said.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That&apos;s right, boss. Until he touch me, I forgot.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Why <span class="ff4">didn&apos;t</span> they scream, John ? He hurt them enough to make them bleed, their parents were right</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upstairs, so why didn&apos;t they scream?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John looked at me from his haunted eyes. &quot;He say to the one, &apos;If you make noise, it&apos;s your sister I kill, not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y100 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you&apos;, He say that same to the other. You see?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes&quot;, I whispered, and I <span class="ff4">could</span> see it. The Detterick porch in the dark. Wharton leaning over them like a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ghoul. One of them had maybe started to cry out, so Wharton had hit her and she had bled from the nose.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That&apos;s where most of it had come from.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He kill them with they love&quot;, John said. &quot;They love for each other. You see how it was?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2bb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I nodded, incapable of speech.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He smiled. The tears were flowing again, but he smiled. &quot;That&apos;s how it is every day&quot;, he said, &quot;all over</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the worl&apos;.&quot; Then he lay down and turned his face to the wall.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I stepped out into the Mile, locked his cell, and walked up to the duty desk. I still felt like a man in a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dream. I realized I could hear Brutal&apos;s thoughts - a very faint whisper, how to spell some word, <span class="ff4">receive,</span> I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think it was. He was thinking <span class="ff4">i before</span> e, <span class="ff4">except after c, is that how the dadratted thing goes?</span> Then he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1aa ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked up, started to smile, and stopped when he got a good look at me. &quot;Paul?&quot; he asked. &quot;Are you all</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y199 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes.&quot; Then I told him what John had told me - not all of it, and certainly not about what his touch had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">done to me (I never told anyone that part, not even Janice; Elaine Connelly will be the first to know of it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">- if, that is, she wants to read these last pages after reading all the rest of them), but I repeated what John</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had said about wanting to go. That seemed to relieve Brutal - a bit, anyway - but I sensed (heard?) him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wondering if I hadn&apos;t made it up, just to set his mind at ease. Then I felt him deciding to believe it, simply</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y163 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because it would make things a little easier for him when the time came.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Paul, is that infection of yours coming back?&quot; he asked. &quot;You look all flushed.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1af ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No, I think I&apos;m okay&quot;, I said. I wasn&apos;t, but I felt sure by then that John was right and I was going to be. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could feel that tingle starting to subside.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;All the same, it might not hurt you to go on in your office there and lie down a bit.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lying down was the <span class="ff4">last</span> thing I felt like right then - the idea seemed so ridiculous that I almost laughed.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What I felt like doing was maybe building myself a little house, then shingling it, and plowing a garden</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

I went over to Admin, and then I tromped back and forth across the empty exercise</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y206 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yard until the guards in the towers must have thought I was crazy. But by the time my shift was over, I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was starting to calm down again, and that rustle of thoughts in my head -like a stirring of leaves, it was -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had pretty much quieted down.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Still, halfway home that morning, it came back strong. The way my urinary infection had. I had to park</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my Ford by the side of the road, get out, and sprint nearly half a mile, head down, arms pumping, breath</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tearing in and out of my throat as warm as something that you&apos;ve carried in your armpit. Then, at last, I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ycf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to feel really normal. I trotted halfway back to where the Ford was parked and walked the rest of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the way, my breath steaming in the chilly air. When I got home, I told Janice that John Coffey had said</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was ready, that he wanted to go. She nodded, looking relieved. Was she really? I couldn&apos;t say. Six</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hours before, even three, I would have known, but by then I didn&apos;t. And that was good. John had kept</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">saying that he was tired, and now I could understand why. It would have tired anyone out, what he had.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Would have made anyone long for rest and for quiet.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yef ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Janice asked me why I looked so flushed and smelled so sweaty, I told her I had stopped the car on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y108 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my way home and gone running for awhile, running hard. I told her that much - as I may have said</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(there&apos;s too many pages here now for me to want to look back through and make sure), lying wasn&apos;t much</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a part of our marriage - but I didn&apos;t tell her why.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y229 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And she didn&apos;t ask.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h6 yf4 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">9.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There were no thunderstorms on the night it came John Coffey&apos;s turn to walk the Green Mile. It was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seasonably cold for those parts at that time of year, in the thirties, I&apos;d guess, and a million stars spilled</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y163 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">across used-up, picked-out fields where frost glittered on fenceposts and glowed like diamonds on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y18f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dry skeletons of July&apos;s corn.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y10c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutus Howell was out front for this one - he would do the capping and tell Van Hay to roll when it was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y11a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time.

It was one thing to know he was willing - it made it at least possible for us to do</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y166 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our job - but it was another to know we were going to electrocute him for someone else&apos;s crime.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He was in his office, buttoning up his overcoat.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y31b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His face was pale, his hands shaking so badly that he was making quite some production of those</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y592 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buttons. I almost wanted to knock his fingers aside and do the coat up myself, like you would with a little</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y593 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kid. The irony was that Melinda had looked better when Jan and I went to see her the previous weekend</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y594 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than Hal had looked earlier on John Coffey&apos;s execution evening.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y595 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I won&apos;t be staying for this one,&quot; he had said. &quot;Curtis will be there, and I know Coffey will be in good</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y596 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands with you and Brutus.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y321 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, sir, we&apos;ll do our best&quot;, I said. &quot;Is there any word on Percy?&quot; Is he coming back around? is what I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y322 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meant, of course. Is he even now sitting in a room somewhere and telling someone - some doctor, most</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y323 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">likely - about how we zipped him into the nut-coat and threw him into the restraint room like any other</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y597 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problem child ... any other lugoon, in Percy&apos;s language? And if he is, are they believing him?</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y325 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But according to Hal, Percy was just the same. Not talking, and not, so far as anyone could tell, in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y326 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world at all. He was still at Indianola - &quot;being evaluated&quot;, Hal had said, looking mystified at the phrase -</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y327 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but if there was no improvement, he would be moving along soon.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y598 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;How&apos;s Coffey holding up?&quot; Hal had asked then. He had finally managed to do up the last button of his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y599 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coat.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y564 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I nodded. &quot;He&apos;ll be fine, Warden.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He&apos;d nodded back, then gone to the door, looking old and ill. &quot;How can so much good and so much evil</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live together in the same man? How could the man who cured my wife be the same man who killed those</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little girls? Do you understand that?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I had told him I didn&apos;t, the ways of God were mysterious, there was good and evil in all of us, ours not to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reason why, -hotcha, hotcha, row-dee-dow. Most of what I told him were things I&apos;d learned in the church</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Praise Jesus, The Lord Is Mighty, Hal nodding the whole time and looking sort of exalted. He could</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">afford to nod, couldn&apos;t he? Yes. And look exalted, too. There was a deep sadness on his face - he was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shaken, all right; I never doubted it - but there were no tears this time, because he had a wife to go home</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to, his companion to go home to, and she was fine. Thanks to John Coffey, she was well and fine and the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man who had signed John &apos;s death warrant could leave and go to her. He didn&apos;t have to watch what came</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">next. He would be able to sleep that night in his wife&apos;s warmth while John Coffey lay on a slab in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">basement of County Hospital, growing cool as the friendless, speechless hours moved toward dawn. And</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y571 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I hated Hal for those things. Just a little, and I&apos;d get over it, but it was hate, all right.

Even if it didn&apos;t do that, it was apt to electroplate, leaving a kind of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y59 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charred photograph of itself on the skin of his chest. I had seen it before. I&apos;d seen most everything during</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my years on the Mile. More than was good for me.

Still, I had a nightmarish moment when I thought they were still going to come</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up small, and we&apos;d have to take him back to his cell while Sam Broderick, who was head of the shop</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guys in those days, was found and tinkered some more. I gave a final, extra-hard shove with the heels of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my hands and the clamp on my side closed. John &apos;s leg jerked and he gasped. I had pinched him.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Sorry, John ,&quot; I murmured, and glanced at Harry. He had gotten his clamp fixed more easily (either the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">extension on his side was a little bigger or John &apos;s right calf was a little smaller), but he was looking at</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the result with a doubtful expression. I guessed I could understand why; the modified clamps had a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hungry look, their jaws seeming to gape like the mouths of alligators.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It&apos;ll be all right&quot;, I said, hoping that I sounded convincing ... and that I was telling the truth. &quot;Wipe your</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yed ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">face, Harry.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He swabbed at it with his arm, wiping away tears from his cheeks and beads of sweat from his forehead.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We turned.

It was almost time.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal had clamped one of John &apos;s wrists, Dean the other. Over Dean&apos;s shoulder I could see the doctor,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unobtrusive as ever, standing against the wall with his black bag between his feet.

Maybe back then they had a clearer idea of what was right for a doctor</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be doing, and what was a perversion of the special promise they make, the one where they swear first</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of all to do no harm.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean nodded to Brutal.

Brutal, who died of a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y56 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heart attack about twenty-five years later (he was eating a fish sandwich and watching TV wrestling</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y57 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when it happened, his sister said), was a good man.

How I would love to tell myself that. What I saw was fear, misery,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">incompletion, and incomprehension.

He looked at me, and now I could see huge droplets</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of sweat standing out on the curve of his naked skull. As big as robin&apos;s eggs, they looked.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Please, boss, don&apos;t put that thing over my face,&quot; he said in a moaning little whisper. &quot;Please don&apos;t put me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the dark, don&apos;t make me go into the dark, I&apos;s afraid of the dark.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal was looking at me, eyebrows raised, frozen in place, the mask in his hands.

I thought as fast as I could and as well as I could -hard to do, with my head</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y116 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pounding the way it was. The mask was tradition, not law. It was, in fact, to spare the witnesses. And</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y21b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suddenly I decided that they did not need to be spared, not this once.

They didn&apos;t know that, but we did, and I decided</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was going to grant this last request.

He pressed a finger into it and licked</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the tip, but he hardly had to; I could see the ugly brown thing dripping. He tucked it into the cap, then put</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the cap on John &apos;s head. For the first time I saw that Brutal was pale, too - pasty white, on the verge of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">passing out. I thought of him saying that he felt, for the first time in his life, that he was in danger of hell,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because we were fixing to kill a gift of God. I felt a sudden strong need to retch. I controlled it, but only</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with an effort. Water from the sponge was dripping down the sides of John &apos;s face.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y58 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dean Stanton ran the strap - let out to its maximum length on this occasion - across John &apos;s chest and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y30 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave it to me.

After John Coffey, he requested and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y32 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">received a transfer away from Old Sparky, over to C Block, and there a prisoner stabbed him in the throat</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y33 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with a shank and let out his life&apos;s blood on the dirty board floor. I never knew why. I don&apos;t think anyone</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ever knew why. Old Sparky seems such a thing of perversity when I look back on those days, such a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deadly bit of folly. Fragile as blown glass, we are, even under the best of conditions. To kill each other</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with gas and electricity, and in cold blood? The folly. The horror.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y37 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brutal checked the strap, then stood back. I waited for him to speak, but he didn&apos;t. As he crossed his</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y38 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands behind his back and stood at parade rest, I knew that he wouldn&apos;t. Perhaps couldn&apos;t. I didn&apos;t think I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y39 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could, either, but then I looked at John &apos;s terrified, weeping eyes and knew I had to. Even if it damned me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forever, I had to.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Roll on two,&quot; I said in a dusty, cracking voice I hardly recognized as my own.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y90 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The cap hummed.

His big knees made caged</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y92 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pistoning motions, but the clamps on his ankles held.

Then he fell against the seatback, the cap</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y93 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming askew on his head a little, smoke - a sort of charry mist - drifting out from beneath it. But on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y94 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole, you know, it was quick.

I sat on my steps and hung my head over</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y145 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my knees and cried.

I stood where I was for a moment,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looking down at the table, taking in the fact that it was bare again except for the breakfast tray Elaine had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y410 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought me that morning, my scattered papers at last gone. I somehow couldn&apos;t believe I was done ... and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as you can see, since all this was written after I recorded John Coffey&apos;s execution and gave the last batch</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y209 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of pages to Elaine, I was not.

Most were in groups, but Brad Dolan, I saw, was walking alone. That was sort of a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y20f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happy sight; maybe the world hasn&apos;t gone entirely to hell, after all. One of his joke-books was sticking</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of his back pocket. The path to the parking lot goes by the croquet course, so he saw me there, but he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y225 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">didn&apos;t give me either a wave or a scowl. That was fine by me. He got into his old Chevrolet with the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yf9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bumper sticker reading I HAVE SEEN GOD AND HIS NAME IS NEWT. Then he was gone to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1e0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wherever he goes when he isn&apos;t here, laying a thin trail of discount motor oil behind.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y227 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Around four o&apos;clock, Elaine joined me, just as she had promised. From the look of her eyes, she&apos;d done a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little more crying. She put her arms around me and hugged me tight. &quot;Poor John Coffey&quot;, she said. &quot;And</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yfd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">poor Paul Edgecombe, too.&quot;</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Our shadows</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked as if they were dancing. Perhaps in the Make Believe Ballroom we used to listen to on the radio</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back in those days.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At last she got herself under control and drew back from me.

Toward the shed down by the wall between Georgia Pines and the world of younger people.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2ee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;She died - of a heart attack, not a brain tumor - ten or eleven years later.

Three months after the day we walked down into the woods</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together (I would have held her hand, if I hadn&apos;t been afraid of hurting her bunched and swollen fingers),</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2f5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Elaine Connelly died quietly in her bed. As with Melinda Moores, death came as the result of a heart</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attack. The orderly who found her said she looked peaceful, as if it had come suddenly and without much</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y47f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pain. I hope he was right about that. I loved Elaine. And I miss her. Her and Janice and Brutal and just all</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y480 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of them.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We reached the second shed on the path, the one down by the wall. It stood back in a bower of scrub</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y482 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pines, its sagging roof and boarded-over windows laced and dappled with shadows. I started toward it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y483 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Elaine hung back a moment, looking fearful.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y484 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It&apos;s all right,&quot; I said. &quot;Really. Come on.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2fd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was no latch on the door - there had been once, but it had been torn away - and so I used a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2fe ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">folded-over square of cardboard to wedge it shut. I pulled it free now, and stepped into the shed. I left the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2ff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">door as wide open as it would go, because it was dark inside.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y300 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Paul, what? ... Oh. Oh!&quot; That second &quot;oh&quot; was just shy of a scream.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y478 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was a table pushed off to one side. On it was a flashlight and a brown paper bag. On the dirty floor</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a Hav-A-Tampa cigar box I&apos;d gotten from the concession man who refills the home&apos;s soft-drink and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">candy machines. I&apos;d asked him for it special, and since his company also sells tobacco products, it was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y51f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">easy for him to get.

At first I didn&apos;t think he was going to be</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">able to get over the side of the box this time, but he made it with one final lunge. He landed on his side,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then regained his feet, and came over to me.

I rolled it across the shed&apos;s uneven,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y104 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">splintery floor, and he was after it at once. He didn&apos;t run with his old speed, and his limp was painful to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y115 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">watch, but why should he have been either fast or surefooted? As I&apos;ve said, he was old, a Methuselah of a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse. Sixty-four, at least.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y162 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He reached the spool, which struck the far wall and bounced back. He went around it, then lay down on</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yee ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his side. Elaine started forward and I held her back. After a moment, Mr. Jingles found his feet again.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Slowly, so slowly, he nosed the spool back to me. When he&apos;d first come - I&apos;d found him lying on the steps</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leading to the kitchen in just that same way, as if he&apos;d travelled a long distance and was exhausted - he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had still been able to guide the spool with his paws, as he had done all those years ago on the Green Mile.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That was beyond him, now; his hindquarters would no longer support him. Yet his nose was as educated</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as ever. He just had to go from one end of the spool to the other to keep it on course. When he reached</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y287 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me, I picked him up in one hand - no more than a feather, he weighed - and the spool in the other. His</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bright dark eyes never left it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1c1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t do it again, Paul,&quot; Elaine said in a broken voice. &quot;I can&apos;t bear to watch him.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1ba ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I understood how she felt, but thought she was wrong to ask it. He loved chasing and fetching the spool;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1d3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after all the years, he still loved it just as much. We should all be so fortunate in our passions.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1bc ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;There are peppermint candies in the bag, too,&quot; I said. &quot;Canada Mints. I think he still likes them - he</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y257 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">won&apos;t stop sniffing, if I hold one out to him - but his digestion has gotten too bad to eat them. I bring him</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y201 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toast, instead.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I squatted again, broke a small fragment off the piece I&apos;d brought with me from the sunroom, and put it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y258 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the floor. Mr. Jingles sniffed at it, then picked it up in his paws and began to eat. His tail was coiled</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neatly around him. He finished, then looked expectantly up.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y194 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Sometimes us old fellas can surprise you with our appetites&quot;, I said to Elaine, and handed her the toast.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You try.&quot;</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

One day when I went out for my early-morning walk, he was just here, lying on the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y19c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kitchen steps. I knew who he was right away, but I got a spool out of the laundry room occasional basket</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yc6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just to be sure. And I got him a cigar box. Lined it with the softest stuff I could find. He&apos;s like us, Ellie, I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yff ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think-most days just one big sore place. Still, he hasn&apos;t lost all his zest for living. He still likes his spool,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y112 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and he still likes a visit from his old blockmate. Sixty years I held the story of John Coffey inside me,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sixty and more, and now I&apos;ve told it. I kind of had the idea that&apos;s why he came back. To let me know I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should hurry up and do it while there was still time. Because I&apos;m like him - getting there.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y114 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Getting where?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y101 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Oh, you know&quot;, I said, and we watched Mr. Jingles for awhile in silence. Then, for no reason I could tell</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y102 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you, I tossed the spool again, even though Elaine had asked me not to. Maybe only because, in a way,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yce ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him chasing a spool was like old people having their slow and careful version of sex - you might not</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y196 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want to watch it, you who are young and convinced that, when it comes to old age, an exception will be</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y105 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made in your case, but <span class="ff4">they </span>still want to do it.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yd1 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mr. Jingles set off after the rolling spool again, clearly with pain, and just as clearly (to me, at least) with</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y107 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all his old, obsessive enjoyment.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y197 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Ivy-glass windows,&quot; she whispered, watching him go.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y22b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Ivy-glass windows,&quot; I agreed, smiling.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1a9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;John Coffey touched the mouse the way he touched you.

Whatever power worked through John did that - that&apos;s what I think, anyway - and now it&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2bd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finally wearing off.

I knew what was there, for one thing; for another, the past had suddenly doubled</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the present, making one terrible image, three-dimensional in its reality. It wasn&apos;t Brad Dolan</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yea ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing there in the doorway but Percy Wetmore. In another moment he would rush into the shed and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yeb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crush Mr. Jingles (who no longer had a hope of outrunning him) under his shoe, and this time there was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no John Coffey to bring him back from the edge of death.

I tried to convince</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b6 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">myself that I could still see it, and then Elaine burst into loud sobs. She bent painfully, and picked up the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouse I had first seen on the Green Mile, coming up to the duty desk as fearlessly as a man approaching</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his peers .. . or his friends.

My eyes happened on the bag with the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 yec ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peppermint candies in it, and that did it - the tears began to come.

I suppose a few folks reading this might, but mostly not. Yet it made</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">front-page headlines from coast to coast when it happened. We were outside Birmingham in a driving</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rain, Janice complaining about her old camera, and a tire blew. The bus waltzed sideways on the wet</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pavement and was hit broadside by a truck hauling fertilizer. The truck slammed the bus into a bridge</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">abutment at better than sixty miles an hour, crushed it against the concrete, and broke it in half. Two</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shiny, rain-streaked pieces spun in two opposite directions, the one with the diesel tank in it exploding</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y60 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and sending a red-black fireball up into the rainygray sky. At one moment Janice was complaining about</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y61 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her old Kodak, and at the very next I found myself lying on the far side of the underpass in the rain and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">staring at a pair of blue nylon panties that had spilled out of someone&apos;s suitcase. WEDNESDAY was</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stitched on them in black thread. There were burst-open suitcases everywhere. And bodies. And parts of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bodies. There were seventy-three people on that bus, and only four survived the crash. I was one of them,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y3e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the only one not seriously hurt.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y62 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I got up and staggered among the burst-open suitcases and shattered people, crying out my wife&apos;s name. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y63 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kicked aside an alarm clock, I remember that, and I remember seeing a dead boy of about thirteen lying</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y64 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in a strew of glass with P.F. Flyers on his feet and half his face gone. I felt the rain beating on my own</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y152 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">face, then I went through the underpass and it was gone for awhile. When I came out on the other side it</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y83 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was there again, hammering my cheeks and forehead. Lying by the shattered cab of the overturned</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y84 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fertilizer truck, I saw Jan. I recognized her by her red dress - it was her second-best. The best she had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y45 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been saving for the actual graduation, of course.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y96 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She wasn&apos;t quite dead. I have often thought it would have been better - for me, if not for her - if she had</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y97 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been killed instantly. It might have made it possible for me to let her go a little sooner, a little more</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y98 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">naturally. Or perhaps I&apos;m only kidding myself about that. All I know for sure is that I have <span class="ff4">never</span> let her</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y85 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go, not really.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y140 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She was trembling all over. One of her shoes had come off and I could see her foot jittering. Her eyes</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y141 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were open but blank, the left one full of blood, and as I fell on my knees next to her in the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y142 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smoky-smelling rain, all I could think of was that jitter meant she was being electrocuted; she was being</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y153 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">electrocuted and I had to hold the roll before it was too late.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y15a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Help me!&quot; I screamed. &quot;Help me, someone help me!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y145 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">No one helped, no one even came. The rain pounded down - a hard, soaking rain that flattened</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My still-black hair against my skull - and I held her in my arms and no one came.

There was no moment of awareness - the eyes clearing, the lips moving in some whispered</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 ye8 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">final declaration of love. There was a kind of shivery clench in the flesh beneath my hands, and then she</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y150 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was gone. I thought of Melinda Moores for the first time in years, then, Melinda sitting up in the bed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y151 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where all the doctors at Indianola General Hospital had believed she would die; Melinda Moores looking</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fresh and rested and peering at John Coffey with bright, wondering eyes.

We found each other.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I put my wife&apos;s poor, mangled head down on the wet pavement of the interstate highway, got to my feet</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(it was easy; I had a little cut on the side of my left hand, but that was all), and screamed his name into</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y8f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the shadows of the underpass.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h9 y259 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;John! JOHN COFFEY! WHERE ARE YOU, BIG BOY?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b2 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I walked toward those shadows, kicking aside a teddy-bear with blood on its fur, a pair of steel rimmed</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyeglasses with one shattered lens, a severed hand with a garnet ring on the pinky finger. &quot;You <span class="ff4">saved</span></div><div class="t m0 x4 h9 y1b4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hal&apos;s wife, why not my wife?

No answer</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1b7 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then and no answer now.

Since that day I have never had pneumonia, or</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the flu, or even a strep throat. I have never had another urinary infection, or so much as an infected cut. I</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y1cf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have had colds, but they have been infrequent - six or seven years apart, and although people who don&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a5 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have colds often are supposed to suffer more serious ones, that has never been the case with me.

And although I suppose it will sound strange to</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some reading this in spite of all I have said, part of me relished the pain that came when that gallstone</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">went. It was the only serious pain I&apos;d had since that problem with my waterworks, twenty-four years</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before. The ills that have taken my friends and same-generation loved ones until there are none of them</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">left - the strokes, the cancers, the heart attacks, the liver diseases, the blood diseases - have all left me</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">untouched, have swerved to avoid me the way a man driving a car swerves to avoid a deer or a raccoon</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2f ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the road. The one serious accident I was in left me untouched save for a scratch on the hand. In 1932,</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y81 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John Coffey inoculated me with life. <span class="ff4">Electrocuted</span> me with life, you might say.

Truth to tell, I wish for it already and have ever since Elaine</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4a9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Connelly died. Need I tell you?</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y34 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I look back over these pages, leafing through them with my trembling, spotted hands, and I wonder if</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is some meaning here, as in those books which are supposed to be uplifting and ennobling. I think</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back to the sermons of my childhood, booming affirmations in the church of Praise Jesus, The Lord Is</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mighty, and I recall how the preachers used to say that God&apos;s eye is on the sparrow, that He sees and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y158 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">marks even the least of His creations. When I think of Mr. Jingles, and the tiny scraps of wood we found</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y159 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in that hole in the beam, I think that is so. Yet this same God sacrificed John Coffey, who tried only to do</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5c9 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good in his blind way, as savagely as any Old Testament prophet ever sacrificed a defenseless Iamb ... as</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5ca ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abraham would have sacrificed his own son if actually called upon to do so. I think of John saying that</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y5cb ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wharton killed the Detterick twins with their love for each other, and that it happens every day, all over</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b3 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world. If it happens, God <span class="ff4">lets</span> it happen, and when we say &quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot; God replies, &quot;I don&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y4b4 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">care.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y149 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I think of Mr. Jingles dying while my back was turned and my attention usurped by an unkind man</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whose finest emotion seemed to be a species of vindictive curiosity. I think of Janice, jittering away her</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">last mindless seconds as I knelt with her in the rain.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stop it, I<span class="ff3"> tried to tell John that day in his cell. </span>Let go of my hands, I&apos;m going to drown if you don&apos;t.

And</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something a bit different wakes us all up a little, maybe - lets us see the old business of storytelling in a</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y2e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new way.

I was able to determine that Brutal might indeed have</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y35 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called the mouse on the Mile Steamboat Willy - the Disney cartoon had been in existence almost four</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y36 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years by then - but I have a sneaking suspicion that the little pornographic comic book featuring Popeye</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y6e ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Olive Oyl is an artifact out of time.

Because I took</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y71 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Charles Dickens as my model, I asked several people how Dickens had handled the problem of</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y148 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">refreshing his readers, recollections at the beginning of each new episode. I had expected something like</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y149 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the synopses which preceded each installment of my beloved <span class="ff4">Saturday Evening Post</span> serials, and</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y14a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discovered that Dickens had not been so crude; he built the synopsis into the actual story.</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y41 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While I was trying to decide how to do this, my Wife began telling me (she doesn&apos;t exactly nag, but</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y42 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sometimes she <span class="ff4">advocates</span> rather ruthlessly) that I had never really finished the story of Mr. Jingles, the</div><div class="t m0 x4 h7 y43 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">circus mouse.
